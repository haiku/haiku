<h2>What is hey?</h2>
<CODE>hey</CODE> is a small public domain scripting utility which works with standard <FONT COLOR=#0000ff>B</FONT><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>e</FONT>OS scripting. It comes with source which you can modify as you wish. If you want your modification in the standard distribution, just drop me a line.
Use it at your own risk.
<p>
<p>
<br>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<UL>
<LI>unzip the archive by doubleclicking on <CODE>hey-YYYYMMDD.zip</CODE> or by dropping it on Expander
<LI>open the right project file depending on the hardware platform and select 'Make' from the 'Project' menu to compile it
<LI>you may want to move the executable (<CODE>hey</CODE>) to <CODE>/boot/home/config/bin</CODE> </p>
</ul>
<p>
<br>

<h2>Usage</h2>
hey should be used from Terminal. When you start it without parameters it will display the command line syntax it accepts:
<PRE><CODE>
hey v1.2.8, written by Attila Mezei (attila.mezei@mail.datanet.hu)
usage: hey [-s][-o] &lt;app|signature|teamid&gt; [let &lt;specifier&gt; do] &lt;verb&gt; &lt;specifier_1&gt; &lt;of
           &lt;specifier_n&gt;&gt;* [to &lt;value&gt;] [with name=&lt;value&gt; [and name=&lt;value&gt;]*]
where  &lt;verb&gt; : DO|GET|SET|COUNT|CREATE|DELETE|GETSUITES|QUIT|SAVE|LOAD|'what'
  &lt;specifier&gt; : [the] &lt;property_name&gt; [ &lt;index&gt; | name | "name" | '"name"' ]
      &lt;index&gt; : int | -int | '['int']' | '['-int']' | '['startint to end']'
      &lt;value&gt; : "string" | &lt;integer&gt; | &lt;float&gt; | bool(value) | int8(value)
                | int16(value) | int32(value) | float(value) | double(value)
                | BPoint(x,y) | BRect(l,t,r,b) | rgb_color(r,g,b,a) | file(path)
options: -s: silent
         -o: output result to stdout for easy parsing

</CODE></PRE>
<br>

<h3>The verb</h3>
The verbs send the following messages:
<ul>
<li>DO: B_EXECUTE_PROPERTY
<li>GET: B_GET_PROPERTY
<li>SET: B_SET_PROPERTY
<li>COUNT: B_COUNT_PROPERTIES
<li>CREATE: B_CREATE_PROPERTY
<li>DELETE: B_DELETE_PROPERTY
<li>GETSUITES: B_GET_SUPPORTED_SUITES
<li>QUIT: B_QUIT_REQUESTED
<li>SAVE: B_SAVE_REQUESTED
<li>LOAD: B_REFS_RECEIVED
</ul>
You can use your own verbs if you specify the value names and constants in the 'value_info' structure. See <A HREF="http://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/bebook/BPropertyInfo_Overview.html">BPropertyInfo</A> and <A HREF="file:///boot/develop/headers/be/app/PropertyInfo.h">PropertyInfo.h</A> for details.
<p>
Note that the verb is not case sensitive but the specifier names (e.g. "Frame", "Label"...) are. You can use 'what' constants
directly, like
<PRE><CODE>hey Application '_ABR'
</CODE></PRE>
will open the about window of the application.<p>
LOAD and SAVE are actually not scripting commands, they are standard BeOS messages (B_REFS_RECEIVED and B_SAVE_REQUESTED). I included them for convenience. E.g. open a file in Application (the path can be relative or absolute):
<PRE><CODE>hey Application load 'file(/boot/home/images/Be.jpg)'
</CODE></PRE>
or save it:
<PRE><CODE>hey Application save Window "Be.jpg"
</CODE></PRE>

<br>

<h3>The specifier</h3>

<p>The specifier can be direct, index, reverse index, range or named. Reverse range is
not supported. If you enter an index which consists of only digits, you can omit the square
brackets:
<PRE><CODE>hey Application get Window 0
</CODE></PRE>

<br>
<h3>The value</h3>

It is easy to use the type names in front of the value but beware that the shell will throw a syntax error if you do this:
<PRE><CODE>hey Application set .... to BPoint(100,100)
</CODE></PRE>
Instead use square brackets or quotes:
<PRE><CODE>hey Application set .... to BPoint[100,100]
hey Application set .... to 'BPoint(100,100)'
</CODE></PRE>

If the value string contains only digits, it will be considered an int32. If it contains digits and a dot,
a float type is assumed. "true" or "false" can also be used as bools.

<p>
<br>
<h2>DEBUG mode</h2>
You can check the message to be sent to the application by setting the DEBUG_HEY preprocessor symbol to 1, and recompiling.<p>
<br>

<h2>History</h2>
v1.2.8
<ul>
<li>
		(Sander Stoks): Added command-line option -o which will output the "result" value
		in the reply message to stdout, so you can use it in shell scripting more easily:
		"hey Becasso get AspectRatio of Canvas 0"
		outputs
		Reply BMessage(B_REPLY):
		   "result" (B_DOUBLE_TYPE) : 0.600
		but "hey -o Becasso get AspectRatio of Canvas 0"
		outputs 0.600000 directly.
</ul>
v1.2.7
<ul>
<li>
		by Sander Stoks: Made a fork since I don't think Attila still supports "hey", and
		because the latest version on BeBits seems to be 1.2.4.
		Changes w.r.t. 1.2.6: When an application returns an error on a message, hey now
		keeps iterating over applications with the same signature.  This is useful because,
		for instance, Terminal starts as a new process for each instance, so it previously
		wouldn't work to move a specific Terminal window using hey.  You can now say
		"hey Terminal set Frame of Window foo to BRect[...]".
</ul>
v1.2.6
<ul>
<li>syntax extended by Sander Stoks <sander@adamation.com> to allow:
		"hey Application let Specifier do ..."
		allowing you to send messages directly to other handlers than the app itself.
		In cooperation with the new Application defined commands (note that some
		Be classes, e.g. BWindow, publish commands as well) this allows, for example:
		"hey NetPositive let Window 0 do MoveBy BPoint[10,10]"
		Note that this is partly redundant, since
		"hey NetPositive let Window 0 do get Title"
		duplicates "hey NetPositive get Title of Window 0"
		But with the old system,
		"hey NetPositive MoveBy of Window 0 with data=BPoint[10,10]"
		couldn't work ("MoveBy" is not defined by the Application itself).
</ul>
v1.2.5
<ul>
<li>'value_info' is supported in BPropertyInfo. This means when you send GETSUITES (B_GET_SUPPORTED_SUITES) the value info is printed after the property infos (name, kind, value, usage).<br>
You can also use application defined commands (as the verb) with hey:<br>
		hey MyBackupApp Backup "Maui"<br>
</ul>
v1.2.4
<ul>
<li>The syntax is extended by <a href="mailto:pfolk@uni.uiuc.edu">Peter Folk</a>
    to contain:
      <br><code>do the x of y -3 of z '"1"'</code><br>
    I.e. "do" =&gt; B_EXECUTE_PROPERTY, optional "the" makes direct specifiers
    more like english, bare reverse-index-specifiers are now handled, and
    named specifiers can contain only digits by quoting it (but make sure the
    shell passes the quotes through).

<li>Hey(target,const char*,reply) was previously limited to 100 tokens.
    It now uses a vector<> so it's only limited by available memory.

<li>Also, the archive name is now Y2K compliant =)
</ul>
v1.2.3
<ul>
<li>new option: -s for silent processing (no reply or errors printed) AM
</ul>
v1.2.2
<ul>
<li>Fixes by Marco Nelissen (marcone@xs4all.nl):<br>
<li>fixed parsing of negative numbers
<li>fixed "with" syntax, which was broken (after a create, "with" would be taken as a specifier)
</ul>
v1.2.1
<ul>
<li>compiled for R4 with minor modifications of BPropertyInfo usage
</ul>
v1.2.0
<ul>
<li>the syntax is extended by Sander Stoks (sander@adamation.com) to contain<br>
		with name=<value> [and name=<value> [...]]<br>
		at the end of the command which will add additional data to the scripting message. E.g:<br>
		hey Becasso create Canvas with name=MyCanvas and size=BRect(100,100,300,300)<br>
		Also a small interpreter is included.

<li>		Detailed printout of B_PROPERTY_INFO in BMessages. Better than BPropertyInfo::PrintToStream().
		Also prints usage info for a property if defined.
</ul>
v1.1.1
<ul>
<li>minor change from chrish@qnx.com to return -1 if an error is
		sent back in the reply message; also added B_COUNT_PROPERTIES support

<li>		The range specifier sent to the target was 1 greater than it should've been. Fixed.

<li>		'hey' made the assumption that the first thread in a team will be the
		application thread (and therefore have the application's name).
		This was not always the case. Fix from Scott Lindsey (wombat@gobe.com).
</ul>
v1.1.0
<ul>
<li>flattened BPropertyInfo is printed if found in the reply of B_GET_SUPPORTED_SUITES
<li>1,2,3 and 4 character message constant is supported (e.g. '1', '12', '123', '1234')
<li>alpha is sent with rgb_color
</ul>
v1.0.0
<ul>
<li>First public release
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

For these examples you need to start the Network preferences application
(the classic way to demo scripting ;-)


<h3>Get the messenger of an application (not useful if you use 'hey'):</h3>
<PRE><CODE>	hey Network get Messenger
</CODE></PRE>
