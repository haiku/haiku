	\class BView
	\ingroup interface
	\ingroup libbe
	\brief View base class.

	A BView is a rectangular area within a window that responds to mouse clicks
	and key presses, and acts as a surface for you to draw on.

	Most Interface Kit classes, with the notable exception of BWindow inherit from
	BView. Some of the time you might use a BView object as is, but most of the
	time you subclass BView to do something unique.

	To create a subclass of BView you generally override one or more of BView's
	hook methods to respond to user events such as MouseDown() or FrameMoved().
	By default a BView does nothing in its hook methods unless otherwise stated,
	it's up to you to define what happens. To override the look of a BView you
	should override the Draw() or DrawAfterChildren() methods. See the section on
	Hook Methods below for more details.

	When a BView object is first created it has no parent or child views. How you
	add a view to the view hierarchy depends on if you want to use a standard
	view with a defined frame rectangle or to use the Layout APIs to position and
	size your view instead.

	If you create a standard view you need to add it to a window or another view
	using the AddChild() method, if you create a layout view you need to add your
	view to a layout using BLayout::AddView() or by adding it to a layout builder.

	Views are not very interesting until they, or one of their parents, are
	attached to a window as many of BView's methods depend on a connection to the
	App Server to do their work. In order to prevent multiple views from altering
	the window simultaneously though locking is required. To perform an action
	while the window is locked you issue the following code:

\code
if (Window()->LockLooper()) {
	...
	Window()->UnlockLooper()
}
\endcode

	Whenever App Server calls a hook method it automatically locks the BWindow for
	you.

	Only one view attached to a window is able to receive keyboard events at a
	time. The view that is able to receive keyboard events such as KeyDown() is
	called the "focus view". MakeFocus() gives or removes focus from a view.
	Call IsFocus() to determine whether or not the view is the window's current
	focus view.

	When a view has focus an indicator should be drawn to inform the user. Typically
	the view is surrounded by a blue rectangle to indicate that it is the window's
	focus view. The color can be queried using the keyboard_navigation_color()
	function in InterfaceDefs.h

	Each view has its own coordinate system with the origin point (0.0, 0.0)
	located at the top left corner. You can convert a BPoint or BRect to or from
	the view's coordinate system to the coordinate system of its parent, or
	of the screen's coordinate system. See the section on Coordinate Conversion
	Methods for more details.

	The Application Server clips a BView to the region where it's permitted to
	draw which is never larger than the view's bound rectangle. A view can never
	draw outside its bounds nor can it draw outside of the bounds rectangle of any
	parent view.

	You may limit the clipping region further by passing a BRegion object to
	ConstrainClippingRegion(). You can obtain the current clipping region by
	calling GetClippingRegion().

	Each view has a ViewColor() that fills the frame rectangle before the
	view does any drawing of its own. The default view color is white, you may
	change the view color by calling SetViewColor() or, as of Haiku R1,
	SetViewUIColor(). A commonly used view color is \c B_PANEL_BACKGROUND_COLOR
	which is a user-defined color used as the view color of most applications.
	If you set the view color to \c B_TRANSPARENT_COLOR then the Application Server
	won't erase the clipping region of the view before updating, this should only
	be used if the view erases itself by drawing on every pixel in the clipping
	region.

	If you want to set the view color of a view to be the same as its parent you
	need to set it within the AttachedToWindow() method of the view like so:

\code
SetViewColor(Parent()->ViewColor());
\endcode

	\fn BView::BView(BRect frame, const char* name, uint32 resizingMode,
		uint32 flags)
	\brief Standard constructor.

	A newly constructed BView object has no parent, you must assign it one by
	passing it into the AddChild() method of another view or window. Once the
	view or a parent view has been attached to a window the view becomes part of
	that window's view hierarchy.

	When the BView object is added as a child the \a frame values are interpreted
	in the parent's coordinate system. The frame rectangle should be specified in
	integral values to align on pixel boundaries, decimal values will be rounded.

	The resizing mode flags and view flags can be set after the view has been
	constructed by calling the SetResizingMode() and SetFlags() methods.

	\param frame The \a frame rectangle of the view.
	\param name The name of the view, can be \c NULL.
	\param resizingMode Defines the view's behavior when its parent is resized.
	       \n\n It combines one of the following horizontal resizing constants:
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_TOP The margin between the top of the view and the top
	           of its parent remains constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_BOTTOM The margin between the bottom of the view and
	           the bottom of its parent remains constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_TOP_BOTTOM The margin between the top and bottom sides
	           of the view and the top and bottom sides of the parent both remain
	           constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_V_CENTER Maintains a constant relationship to the
	           vertical center of the parent view.

	       with one of the following vertical resizing constants:
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_LEFT The margin between the left side of the view and
	           the left side of its parent remains constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_RIGHT The margin between the right side of the view and
	            the right side of the parent remains constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_LEFT_RIGHT The margin between the left and right sides
	           of the view and the left and right sides of its parent both remain
	           constant.
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_H_CENTER The view maintains a constant relationship to
	            the horizontal center of the parent view.

	       or use one of the following combined horizontal/vertical constants:
	       \li \c B_FOLLOW_NONE Equivalent to \c B_FOLLOW_LEFT | \c B_FOLLOW_TOP.

/*!
	\name Drawing Related

	The view must be attached to the window for these methods to work unless
	otherwise stated. Notes on specific methods are provided below:

	DrawBitmap()

	If the the image is bigger than the destination rectangle, it is scaled to fit.

	The asynchronous versions pass the image to Application Server and return
	immediately.

	This can be more efficient in some cases for example to draw several bitmaps
	at once and then call Sync() to tell Application Server to wait for them all
	to finish drawing rather than waiting for each one to draw.

	DrawPicture()

	The asynchronous versions pass the picture to Application Server and return
	immediately.

	This can be more efficient in some cases for example to draw several pictures
	at once and then call Sync() to tell Application Server to wait for them all
	to finish drawing rather than waiting for each one to draw.

	DrawPicture() doesn't alter the graphics state of the view nor do changes to
	the graphics state of the view alter the BPicture object. What the picture
	will look like depends on the graphics parameters that were in effect when the
	picture was recorded.

	DrawString()

	The \a string is drawn in the view's current font and is modified by
	the other parameters of the font such as its direction (left-to-right or
	right-to-left), rotation, spacing, shear, etc. The \a string is always drawn
	left to right even if its text direction is set to right-to-left mode.

	Drawing a string is fastest in \c B_OP_COPY mode and anti-aliasing can
	produce undesirable effects when a string is draw in other modes, especially
	if the string is drawn in the same location repeatedly.

	DrawString() doesn't erase before drawing.
