Using PCI serial ports for debugging
====================================

Modern systems usually don't come with a built-in serial port anymore. This
is unconvenient for low level debugging, since the serial port allows access
to early boot log as well as kernel debugger, even when the display or keyboard
are not working.

It is fortunately possible to add a serial port over the PCI bus on machines
which have appropriate expansion ports. This can be done using expresscard,
mini-PCI, or PCI express ports.

Configuring
-----------

- Install the card in your computer
- Boot Haiku and look in the syslog for the PCI bus scan for the device:

KERN: PCI: [dom 0, bus  5] bus   5, device  0, function  0: vendor 9710, device 9922, revision 00
KERN: PCI:   class_base 07, class_function 00, class_api 02

Write down the address of "base reg 0", this is where the serial port registers
are mapped (it is probably possible to get this information from lspci on Linux
as well?)

Configure serial debug in config/settings/kernel/drivers/kernel:

serial_debug_output true
serial_debug_speed 115200
serial_debug_port 0x4000

Now your kernel is configured to send its output to the serial port. You can
connect another machine to it (using an USB to serial adapter and a NULL modem
cable, for example) and use SerialConnect or a similar tool to see the output
and access the KDL prompt.

Happy debugging!
