* Figure out how to get page flags (modified/accessed) and implement it ;)
	use unmapped/read-only mappings to trigger soft faults
	   for tracking used/modified flags for ARMv5 and ARMv6

* Fix serial port mapping. Currently kernel uses the haiku_loader identity
  mapping for it, but this lives in user virtual address space...
  (Need to not use identity mapping in haiku_loader but just
  map_physical_memory() there too so it can be handed over without issues).

* Seperate ARM architecture/System-On-Chip IP code. Needed very early on 
  (Interrupt Controller, Timer IP block). Should use FDT for this too.

* Use FDT to remove all the seperate board definitions in the build. Use a 
  "minimal ARM architecture version" as the compile flag for ARM support. 
  This to be able to optimize a kernel build for a specific SoC (or family).

* Research stack unwinding to implement backtrace support for KDL & friends.

* Add KDL hangman to the boot floppy image for more enjoyment during porting....

* Userland...........
