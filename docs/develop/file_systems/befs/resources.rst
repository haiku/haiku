The Be File System
================================

Probably the best resource for a description of the inner workings of
BFS is the book "Practical File System Design with the Be File System"
written by Dominic Giampaolo and published by Morgan Kaufmann
Publishers. Although that book is out of print, it's available at the
`Haiku web
site <https://www.haiku-os.org/legacy-docs/practical-file-system-design.pdf>`__.

If you prefer to see how it works in code, please have a look at
`Haiku's BFS
implementation <https://git.haiku-os.org/haiku/tree/src/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/bfs>`__.

If you are interested in the Haiku file system API, please refer to its
documentation as part of the Haiku book.
