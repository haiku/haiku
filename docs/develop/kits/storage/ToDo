#	medium:		of relevance for the next release, needed in the near future
#	high:		of relevance for the next release, needed as soon as possible
#	urgent:		of relevance for the next release, needed yesterday, i.e.

Module:      BEntry
Location:    Entry.cpp
Description: Definition of SYMLINK_MAX belongs to some header file. Remove it.
Priority:    low


Module:      EntryTest
Location:    InitTest1(), InitTest2()
Description: Enable tests with strlen(dir + leaf) > B_PATH_NAME_LENGTH.
Priority:    low
Requires:    - reimpl. of SetTo(const BDirectory *, const char *, bool)


Module:      BPath
Location:    Flatten()
Description: Reimplement for performance reasons. Don't call FlattenedSize().
Priority:    low


Module:      NodeTest
Location:    SyncTest()
Description: Add more thorough tests.
Priority:    low
Requires:    - OBOS kernel


Module:      NodeTest
Location:    LockTest()
Description: Implement when kernel support is available.
Priority:    medium
Requires:    - OBOS kernel


Module:      BFile
Location:    Read/Write[At]()
Description: Verify behavior of B_OPEN_AT_END.
Priority:    medium


Module:      FileTest
Location:    PositionTest()
Description: Uncomment test, when B_OPEN_AT_END behavior is understood.
Priority:    medium
Requires:    - verification of B_OPEN_AT_END behavior


Module:      fs_info.h
Location:    struct fs_info
Description: Change "char device_name[128]" to "char device_name[B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH]"
             whenever appropriate, since B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH is now declared in
             StorageDefs.h.
Priority:    low
Requires:    - filesystem support files in the source hierarchy


Module:      BMimeType/MimeTypeTest
Location:    update_mime_info(), create_app_meta_mime()
Description: Find out, what is the meaning of the force parameter. It does
             obviously not mean, that calling the function twice, the second
             time with force, has the same effect as calling it only at the
             second time. At least the tests indicate, that the second call,
             though with force, does not have any effect at all.
Priority:    medium
Requires:    


Module:      VolumeTest
Location:    SetNameTest()
Description: Check whether the mount point is renamed properly.
Priority:    low
