# The original header is preserved below for reference.  It is noted that there
# is a "newer" version which differs in some cosmetic details (but actually
# stopped updates several years ago); we have decided to not change the header
# unless there is also a change in content.
#
# To further muddy the waters, it is noted that changes to this file as part of
# maintenance of ncurses (since 1996) are generally conceded to be copyright
# under the ncurses MIT-style license.  That was the effect of the agreement
# which the principal authors of ncurses made in 1998.  However, since much of
# the file itself is of unknown authorship (and the disclaimer below makes it
# obvious that Raymond cannot or will not convey rights over those parts),
# there is no explicit copyright notice on the file itself.
#
# It would also be a nuisance to split the file into unknown/known authorship
# and move pieces as they are maintained, since many of the maintenance changes
# have been small corrections to Raymond's translations to/from termcap format,
# correcting the data but not the accompanying annotations.
#
# In any case, note that almost half of this file is not data but annotations
# which reflect creative effort.  Furthermore, the structure of entries to
# reuse common chunks also is creative (and subject to copyright).  Finally,
# some portions of the data are derivative work under a compatible MIT-style
# license from xterm.

#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL
# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and
# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical
# termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not.
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order
# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from
# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear
# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections
# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes.
# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or
# product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress :am: capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (:vb:) rather than :bl:.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.
#
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries.
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages.
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tack(1m), the terminfo action checker
# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).
#
# TABSET FILES
#
# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset
# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy
# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)
# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.
#
# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location
# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling
# this file.
#
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,
# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and
# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe.
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool.
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## ANSI, UNIX CONSOLE, AND SPECIAL TYPES

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

# ANSI X3.64 from emory!mlhhh (Hugh Hansard) via BRL

# The following is an entry for the full ANSI 3.64 (1977).  It lacks
# padding, but most terminals using the standard are "fast" enough
# not to require any -- even at 9600 bps.  If you encounter problems,
# try including the padding specifications.
#
# Note: the :as: and :ae: specifications are not implemented here, for
# the available termcap documentation does not make clear WHICH alternate
# character set to specify.  ANSI 3.64 seems to make allowances for several.
# Please make the appropriate adjustments to fit your needs -- that is
# if you will be using alternate character sets.
#
# There are very few terminals running the full ANSI 3.64 standard,
# so I could only test this entry on one verified terminal (Visual 102).
# I would appreciate the results on other terminals sent to me.

# The PgUp and PgDn are prefixed with ESC so that tn3270 can be used on Unix
# (^U and ^D are already defined for tn3270).  The ESC is safe for vi but it
# does "beep".  ESC ESC i is used for Ins to avoid tn3270 ESC i for coltab.
# Note that :kl: is always BS, because PC-dos can tolerate this change.
# Caution: vi is limited to 256 string bytes, longer crashes or weirds out vi.
# Consequently the End keypad key could not be set (it is relatively safe and
# actually useful because it sends ^@ O, which beeps and opens a line above).

#### Apple

######## Terminal.app

# nsterm*|Apple_Terminal - AppKit Terminal.app
#
# Terminal.app is a Terminal emulator bundled with NeXT's NeXTSTEP and
# OPENSTEP/Mach operating systems, and with Apple's Rhapsody, Mac OS X
# Server and Mac OS X operating systems. There is also a
# "terminal.app" in GNUstep, but I believe it to be an unrelated
# codebase and I have not attempted to describe it here.
#
# For NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP/Mach, Rhapsody and Mac OS X Server 1.0, you
# are pretty much on your own. Use "nsterm-7-m" and hope for the best.
# You might also try "nsterm-7" and "nsterm-old" if you suspect your
# version supports color.
#
# To determine the version of Terminal.app you're using by running:
#
#     echo "$TERM_PROGRAM" "$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION"
#
# For Apple_Terminal v309+, use "nsterm-256color" (or "nsterm-bce")
#
# For Apple_Terminal v200+, use "nsterm-16color" (a.k.a. "nsterm")
#
# For Apple_Terminal v71+/v100+, use "nsterm-bce".
#
# For Apple_Terminal v51+, use "nsterm-7-c" or "nsterm-7-c-s".
#
# For Apple_Terminal v41+, use "nsterm-old", or "nsterm-s".
#
# For all earlier versions (Apple_Terminal), try "nsterm-7-m"
# (monochrome) or "nsterm-7" (color); "nsterm-7-m-s" and "nsterm-7-s"
# might work too, but really you're on your own here since these
# systems are very obsolete and I can't test them. I do welcome
# patches, though :).

# Other Terminals:
#
# For GNUstep_Terminal, you're probably best off using "linux" or
# writing your own terminfo.

# For MacTelnet, you're on your own. It's a different codebase, and
# seems to be somewhere between "vt102", "ncsa" and "xterm-color".

# For iTerm.app, see "iterm".

#
# The AppKit Terminal.app descriptions all have names beginning with
# "nsterm". Note that the statusline (-s) versions use the window
# titlebar as a phony status line, and may produce warnings during
# compilation as a result ("tsl uses 0 parameters, expected 1".)
# Ignore these warnings, or even ignore these entries entirely. Apps
# which need to position the cursor or do other fancy stuff inside the
# status line won't work with these entries. They're primarily useful
# for programs like Pine which provide simple notifications in the
# status line. Please note that non-ASCII characters don't work right
# in the status line, since Terminal.app incorrectly interprets their
# Unicode codepoints as MacRoman codepoints (in earlier Mac OS X
# versions) or only accepts status lines consisting entirely of
# characters from the first 256 Unicode positions (including C1 but
# not C0 or DEL.)
#
# The Mythology* of AppKit Terminal.app:
#
# In the days of NeXTSTEP 0.x and 1.x there were two incompatible
# bundled terminal emulators, Shell and Terminal. Scott Hess wrote a
# shareware replacement for Terminal called "Stuart" which NeXT bought
# and used as the basis for the Terminal.app in NeXTSTEP 2+,
# OPENSTEP/Mach, Apple Rhapsody, Mac OS X Server 1.0, and Mac OS X. I
# don't know the TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION settings or
# capabilities for the early versions, but I believe that the
# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION may have been reset at some point.
#
# The early versions were tailored to the NeXT character set. Sometime
# after the Apple acquisition the encoding was switched to MacRoman
# (initially with serious altcharset bugs due to incomplete conversion
# of the old NeXT code,) and then later to UTF-8. Also sometime during
# or just prior to the early days of Mac OS X, the Terminal grew ANSI
# 8-color support (initially buggy when combined with attributes, but
# that was later fixed.) More recently, around Mac OS X version 10.3
# or so (Terminal.app v100+) xterm-like 16-color support was added. In
# some versions (for instance 133-1 which shipped with Mac OS X
# version 10.4) this suffered from the <bce> bug, but that seems to
# have been fixed in Mac OS X version 10.5 (Terminal.app v240.2+).
#
# In the early days of Mac OS X the terminal was fairly buggy and
# would routinely crash under load. Many of these bugs seem to have
# been fixed around Mac OS X version 10.3 (Terminal.app v100+) but
# some may still remain. This change seems to correspond to
# Terminal.app reporting "xterm-color" as $TERM rather than "vt100" as
# it did previously.
#
# * This may correspond with what actually happened, but I don't
#   know. It is based on guesswork, hearsay, private correspondence,
#   my faulty memory, and the following online sources and references:

# [1] "Three Scotts and a Duane" by Simson L. Garfinkel
# http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Articles/NeXTWORLD/93.8/93.8.Dec.Community1.html
#
# [2] NeXTSTEP entry from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
# https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nextstep
#
# * Renamed the AppKit Terminal.app entry from "Apple_Terminal" to
#   "nsterm" to comply with the name length and case conventions and
#   limitations of various software packages [notably Solaris terminfo
#   and UNIX.] A single Apple_Terminal alias is retained for
#   backwards-compatibility.
#
# * Added function key support (F1-F4). These only work in Terminal.app
#   version 51, hopefully the capabilities won't cause problems for people
#   using version 41.
#
# * Added "full color" (-c) entries which support the 16-color mode in
#   version 51.
#
# * By default, version 51 uses UTF-8 encoding with broken altcharset
#   support, so "ASCII" (-7) entries without altcharset support were
#   added.

# nsterm - AppKit Terminal.app
#
# Apple's Mac OS X includes a Terminal.app derived from the old NeXT
# Terminal.app. It is a partial VT100 emulation with some xterm-like
# extensions. This terminfo was written to describe versions 41
# (shipped with Mac OS X version 10.0) and 51 (shipped with Mac OS X
# version 10.1) of Terminal.app.
#
# Terminal.app runs under the Mac OS X Quartz windowing system (and
# other AppKit-supported windowing systems.)  On the Mac OS X machine I
# use, the executable for Terminal.app is:
# /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal
#
# If you're looking for a description of the full-screen system
# console which runs under Apple's Darwin operating system on PowerPC
# platforms, see the "xnuppc" entry instead.
#
# There were no function keys in version 41. In version 51, there are
# four working function keys (F1, F2, F3 and F4.) The function keys
# are included in all of these entries.
#
# It does not support mouse pointer position reporting. Under some
# circumstances the cursor can be positioned using option-click; this
# works by comparing the cursor position and the selected position,
# and simulating enough cursor-key presses to move the cursor to the
# selected position. This technique fails in all but the simplest
# applications.
#
# It provides partial ANSI color support (background colors interacted
# badly with bold in version 41, though, as reflected in :ncv:.) The
# monochrome (-m) entries are useful if you've disabled color support
# or use a monochrome monitor. The full color (-c) entries are useful
# in version 51, which doesn't exhibit the background color bug. They
# also enable an xterm-compatible 16-color mode.
#
# The configurable titlebar is set using xterm-compatible sequences;
# it is used as a status bar in the statusline (-s) entries. Its width
# depends on font sizes and window sizes, but 50 characters seems to
# be the default for an 80x24 window.
#
# The MacRoman character encoding is used for some of the alternate
# characters in the "MacRoman" entries; the "ASCII" (-7) entries
# disable alternate character set support entirely, and the "VT100"
# (-acs) entries rely instead on Terminal.app's own buggy VT100
# graphics emulation, which seems to think the character encoding is
# the old NeXT charset instead of MacRoman. The "ASCII" (-7) entries
# are useful in Terminal.app version 51, which supports UTF-8 and
# other ASCII-compatible character encodings but does not correctly
# implement VT100 graphics; once VT100 graphics are correctly
# implemented in Terminal.app, the "VT100" (-acs) entries should be
# usable in any ASCII-compatible character encoding [except perhaps
# in UTF-8, where some experts argue for disallowing alternate
# characters entirely.]
#
# Terminal.app reports "vt100" as the terminal type, but exports
# several environment variables which may aid detection in a shell
# profile (i.e. .profile or .login):
#
# TERM=vt100
# TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=41      # in Terminal.app version 41
# TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=51      # in Terminal.app version 51
#
# For example, the following Bourne shell script would detect the
# correct terminal type:
#
# if [ :"$TERM" = :"vt100" -a :"$TERM_PROGRAM" = :"Apple_Terminal" ]
# then
#     export TERM
#     if [ :"$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION" = :41 ]
#     then
#         TERM="nsterm-old"
#     else
#         TERM="nsterm-c-7"
#     fi
# fi
#
# In a C shell derivative, this would be accomplished by:
#
# if ( $?TERM && $?TERM_PROGRAM && $?TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION) then
#     if ( :"$TERM" == :"vt100" && :"$TERM_PROGRAM" == :"Apple_Terminal" ) then
#          if ( :"$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION" == :41 ) then
#              setenv TERM "nsterm-old"
#          else
#              setenv TERM "nsterm-c-7"
#          endif
#     endif
# endif

# The versions of Terminal.app in Mac OS X version 10.3.x seem to have
# the background color erase feature. The newer version 240.2 in Mac OS X
# version 10.5 does not.
#
# This entry is based on newsgroup comments by Alain Bench, Christian Ebert,
# and D P Schreber comparing to nsterm-c-s-acs.
#
# In Mac OS X version 10.4 and earlier, D P Schreber notes that $TERM
# can be set in Terminal.app, e.g.,
#
#	defaults write com.apple.Terminal TermCapString nsterm-bce
#
# and that it is not set in Terminal's preferences dialog.
#
# Modified for OS X 10.8, omitting bw based on testing with tack -TD
#
# Notes:
# * The terminal description matches the default settings.
# * The keyboard is configurable via a dialog.
# * By default khome, kend, knext and kprev are honored only with a
#   shift-modifier.
# * There are bindings for control left/right arrow (but not up/down).
#   Added those to nsterm-16color, which is the version used for OS X 10.6
# * "Allow VT100 application keypage mode" is by default disabled.
#   There is no way to press keypad-comma unless application mode is enabled
#   and used.
# * 132-column mode stopped working during vttest's tests.  Consider it broken.
# * CHT, REP, SU, SD are buggy.
# * ECH works (also in Leopard), but is not used here for compatibility.
# * The terminal preferences dialog replaces xterm-color by xterm-16color and
#   xterm-256color.  However, it adds "nsterm", so it is possible to use the
#   nsterm entry from this file to override the MacPorts (20110404) or
#   system (20081102) copy of this file.
# + In OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) the TERM which can be set in the preferences
#   dialog defaults to xterm-256color.  Alternative selections are ansi,
#   dtterm, rxvt, vt52, vt100, vt102, xterm and xterm-16color.  However,
#   the menu says "Declare terminal as" without promising to actually emulate
#   the corresponding terminals.  Indeed, changing TERM does not affect the
#   emulation itself.  This means that
#   + the function-keys do not match for dtterm for kf1-kf4 as well as
#     khome/kend
#   + the color model is the same for each setting of TERM (does not match
#     ansi or dtterm).
#   + the shift/control/meta key modifiers from rxvt and xterm variants are not
#     recognised except for a few special cases, i.e., kRIT5 and kLFT5.
#   + the vt52 emulation does not give a usable shell because screen-clearing
#     does not work as expected.
#   + selecting "xterm" or "xterm-16color" sets TERM to "xterm-256color".
# + OSX 10.9 (Yosemite) added more extended keys in the default configuration
#   as well as unmasking F10 (which had been used in the window manager). Those
#   keys are listed in this entry.

######## iTerm, iTerm2

# iTerm 0.10
#
# iTerm.app from http://iterm.sourceforge.net/ is an alternative (and more
# featureful) terminal emulator for Mac OS X.  It is similar enough in
# capabilities to nsterm-16color that I have derived this description from that
# one, but as far as I know they share no code.  Many of the features are
# user-configurable, but I attempt only to describe the default configuration
# (B. Sittler).
#
# According to its documentation, iTerm uses terminfo to obtain function key
# definitions.  For example, if it is started with TERM=xterm, it uses key
# definitons from that terminal description from the local OSX machine.  Those
# $TERM settings may be augmented using the bookmark and profile dialogs. 
# However, the behavior seen with tack does not agree with either the terminfo
# description or the function keys in its "xterm" profile.
#
# NOTES:
# with vttest:
#	reports primary DA as VT100 with AVO: \E[?1;2c
#	reports secondary DA as "\E[>0;95;c"
#	supports blink and underline
#	displays bold text as red

# xnuppc - Darwin PowerPC Console (a.k.a. "darwin")
#
# On PowerPC platforms, Apple's Darwin operating system uses a
# full-screen system console derived from a NetBSD framebuffer
# console. It is an ANSI-style terminal, and is not really VT-100
# compatible.
#
# Under Mac OS X, this is the system console driver used while in
# single-user mode [reachable by holding down Command-S during the
# boot process] and when logged in using console mode [reachable by
# typing ">console" at the graphical login prompt.]
#
# If you're looking for a description of the Terminal.app terminal
# emulator which runs under the Mac OS X Quartz windowing system (and
# other AppKit-supported windowing systems,) see the "nsterm"
# entry instead.
#
# NOTE: Under Mac OS X version 10.1, the default login window does not
# prompt for user name, instead requiring an icon to be selected from
# a list of known users. Since the special ">console" login is not in
# this list, you must make one of two changes in the Login Window
# panel of the Login section of System Prefs to make the special
# ">console" login accessible. The first option is to enable 'Show
# "Other User" in list for network users', which will add a special
# "Other..." icon to the graphical login panel. Selecting "Other..."
# will present the regular graphical login prompt. The second option
# is to change the 'Display Login Window as:' setting to 'Name and
# password entry fields', which replaces the login panel with a
# graphical login prompt.
#
# There are no function keys, at least not in Darwin 1.3.
#
# It has no mouse support.
#
# It has full ANSI color support, and color combines correctly with
# all three supported attributes: bold, inverse-video and underline.
# However, bold colored text is almost unreadable (bolding is
# accomplished using shifting and or-ing, and looks smeared) so bold
# has been excluded from the list of color-compatible attributes
# [using (ncv)]. The monochrome entry (-m) is useful if you use a
# monochrome monitor.
#
# There is one serious bug with this terminal emulation's color
# support: repositioning the cursor onto a cell with non-matching
# colors obliterates that cell's contents, replacing it with a blank
# and displaying a colored cursor in the "current" colors. There is
# no complete workaround at present [other than using the monochrome
# (-m) entries,] but removing the (msgr) capability seemed to help.
#
# The "standout" chosen was simple reverse-video, although a colorful
# standout might be more aesthetically pleasing. Similarly, the bold
# chosen is the terminal's own smeared bold, although a simple
# color-change might be more readable. The color-bold (-b) entries
# uses magenta colored text for bolding instead. The fancy color (-f
# and -f2) entries use color for bold, standout and underlined text
# (underlined text is still underlined, though.)
#
# Apparently the terminal emulator does support a VT-100-style
# alternate character set, but all the alternate character set
# positions have been left blank in the font. For this reason, no
# alternate character set capabilities have been included in this
# description. The console driver appears to be ASCII-only, so (enacs)
# has been excluded [although the VT-100 sequence does work.]
#
# The default Mac OS X and Darwin installation reports "vt100" as the
# terminal type, and exports no helpful environment variables. To fix
# this, change the "console" entry in /etc/ttys from "vt100" to
# "xnuppc-WxH", where W and H are the character dimensions of your
# console (see below.)
#
# The font used by the terminal emulator is apparently one originally
# drawn by Ka-Ping Yee, and uses 8x16-pixel characters. This
# file includes descriptions for the following geometries:
#
#     Pixels        Characters   Entry Name (append -m for monochrome)
#    -------------------------------------------------------------------

# The basic "xnuppc" entry includes no size information, and the

# of the TTY device (which reports incorrectly on my hardware.) The

# Comments in the original are summarized here:
#
# hurd uses 8-bit characters (km).
#
# Although it doesn't do XON/XOFF, we don't want padding characters (xon).
#
# Regarding compatibility to vt100:  hurd doesn't specify :xn:, as we don't
# have the eat_newline_glitch.  It doesn't support setting or removing tab
# stops (hts/tbc).
#
# hurd uses ^H instead of \E[D for cub1, as only ^H implements :bw: and it is
# one byte instead three.
#
# :ic: is not included because hurd has insert mode.
#
# hurd doesn't use ^J for scrolling, because this could put things into the
# scrollback buffer.
#
# gsbom/grbom are used to enable/disable real bold (not intensity bright) mode.
# This is a GNU extension.
#
# The original has commented-out ncv, but is restored here.
#
# Reading the source, RIS resets cnorm, but not xmous.

#### SGI consoles

# Sent by Stefan Stapelberg <stefan@rent-a-guru.de>, 24 Feb 1997, this is
# from SGI's terminfo database.  SGI's entry shows F9-F12 with the codes
# for the application keypad mode.  We have added iris-ansi-ap rather than
# change the original to keypad mode.
#
# (iris-ansi: added rmam/smam based on init string -- esr)
#
# This entry, and those derived from it, is used in xwsh (also known as
# winterm).  Some capabilities that do not fit into the terminfo model
# include the shift- and control-functionkeys:
#
# F1-F12 generate different codes when shift or control modifiers are used.
# For example:
#	F1		\E[001q
#	shift F1	\E[013q
#	control-F1	\E[025q
#
# In application keypad mode, F9-F12 generate codes like vt100 PF1-PF4, i.e.,
# \EOP to \EOS.  The shifted and control modifiers still do the same thing.
#
# The cursor keys also have different codes:
#	control-up	\E[162q
#	control-down	\E[165q
#	control-left	\E[159q
#	control-right	\E[168q

#### OpenBSD consoles
#
# From: Alexei Malinin <Alexei.Malinin@mail.ru>; October, 2011.
#
# The following terminal descriptions for the  AMD/Intel PC console
# were prepared  based on information contained in  the OpenBSD-4.9
# termtypes.master and wscons(4) & vga(4) manuals (2010, November).
#
# Added bce based on testing with tack -TD
# Added several capabilities to pccon+base, reading wsemul_vt100_subr.c -TD
# Changed kbs to DEL and removed keys that duplicate stty settings -TD
#
# Notes from testing with vttest:
#	fails wrapping test
#	no 8-bit controls
#	identifies as vt200 with selective erase, but does not implement DECSCA
#	no vt52 mode
#	also lacks these:
#		ESC # 8	  DEC Screen Alignment Test (DECALN).
#		CSI ? 5 h Reverse Video (DECSCNM).

# Andrey Chernov maintains the FreeBSD termcap distributions.

# I have seen FreeBSD-2.1.5R... The old el1 bug changed, but it is still there.
# Now el1 clears not only to the line beginning, but also a large chunk
# of previous line. But there is another bug - ech does not work at all.
#

# for syscons
# common entry without semigraphics
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.
# Bug? The ech and el1 attributes appear to move the cursor in some cases; for
# instance el1 does if the cursor is moved to the right margin first.  Removed
# by T.Dickey 97/5/3 (ech=\E[%p1%dX, el1=\E[1K)
#
# Setting colors turns off reverse; we cannot guarantee order, so use ncv.
# Note that this disables standout with color.
#
# The emulator sends difference strings based on shift- and control-keys,
# like scoansi:
#	F13-F24 are shifted F1-F12
#	F25-F36 are control F1-F12
#	F37-F48 are shift+control F1-F12
# (sgr removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)
# (terminfo-only capabilities suppressed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)

# For FreeBSD 9 and 10:
# --------------------
# The /etc/ttys entries for console and other ttys are all configured to set
# TERM=xterm.
#
# Testing with tack:
# There is no VT100 line-drawing (uses +'s and -'s)
# Shifted f1-f12 give cons25 codes, rather than xterm function-keys
#
# Testing with vttest:
# Menu 2 diamonds don't work, blink ditto, light background ditto
# The terminal identifies itself as VT100 with AVO
# There is no VT52 support
# There is no doublesize character support
# The terminal supports ECH (like rxvt)
# The terminal does not support send/receive mode
# The terminal supports all of the ISO-6429 cursor-movement
# The terminal supports some of the ISO-6429 miscellaneous tests
#	(SL/SR also leave unexpected char on screen too)
#
# Considering cons25 as a base, the line-drawing mostly works, but is missing
# the cells which happen to have ASCII control-character values:
#	-    ^X    arrow pointing up
#	.    ^Y    arrow pointing down
#	i    ^Y    lantern
#	`    ^D    diamond
#
# Those are removed from this entry's acsc string to avoid confusion.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward are collected here. Older DEC terminals
# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#
# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio
# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.  SunRiver has since changed
# its name to Boundless Technologies; see http://www.boundless.com.
#

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the :xn: glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# :xn: right on vt100. The correct way to handle :xn: is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If :xn:
# is on, am should be on too.
#
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam
# below.
#
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
#
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than :is:/:ct:/:st: because the
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have cursor ("arrows") keys which can operate
# in two different modes: Cursor Mode and Application Mode.  Cursor Mode
# is the reset state, and is assumed to be the normal state.  Application
# Mode is the "set" state.  In Cursor Mode, the cursor keys transmit
# "Esc [ {code}" sequences, conforming to ANSI standards.  In Application
# Mode, the cursor keys transmit "Esc O <code>" sequences.  Application Mode
# was provided primarily as an aid to the porting of VT52 applications.  It is
# assumed that the cursor keys are normally in Cursor Mode, and expected that
# applications such as vi will always transmit the :ks: string.  Therefore,
# the definitions for the cursor keys are made to match what the terminal
# transmits after the :ks: string is transmitted.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then cursor keys are assumed to be in
# "Cursor Mode", and the cursor keys definitions should match that assumption,
# else the application may fail.  It is also expected that applications will
# always transmit the :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have an auxiliary keypad, commonly referred to as
# the "Numeric Keypad", because it is a cluster of numeric and function keys.
# The Numeric Keypad which can operate in two different modes: Numeric Mode and
# Application Mode.  Numeric Mode is the reset state, and is assumed to be
# the normal state.  Application Mode is the "set" state.  In Numeric Mode,
# the numeric and punctuation keys transmit ASCII 7-bit characters, and the
# Enter key transmits the same as the Return key (Note: the Return key
# can be configured to send either LF (\015) or CR LF).  In Application Mode,
# all the keypad keys transmit "Esc O {code}" sequences.  The PF1 - PF4 keys
# always send the same "Esc O {code}" sequences.  It is assumed that the keypad
# is normally in Numeric Mode.  If an application requires that the keypad be
# in Application Mode then it is expected that the user, or the application,
# will set the TERM environment variable to point to a terminfo entry which has
# defined the :ks: string to include the codes that switch the keypad into
# Application Mode, and the terminfo entry will also define function key
# fields to match the Application Mode control codes.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then the keypad is assumed to be in
# Numeric Mode.  If the :ks: string switches the keypad into Application
# Mode, it is expected that the :ke: string will contain the control codes
# necessary to reset the keypad to "Normal" mode, and it is also expected that
# applications which transmit the :ks: string will also always transmit the
# :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# Here's a diagram of the VT100 keypad keys with their bindings.
# The top line is the name of the key (some DEC keyboards have the keys
# labelled somewhat differently, like GOLD instead of PF1, but this is
# the most "official" name).  The second line is the escape sequence it
# generates in Application Keypad mode (where "$" means the ESC
# character).  The third line contains two items, first the mapping of
# the key in terminfo, and then in termcap.

# vt220 termcap written Tue Oct 25 20:41:10 1988 by Alex Latzko
# (not an official DEC entry!)
# The problem with real vt220 terminals is they don't send escapes when in
# in vt220 mode.  This can be gotten around two ways.  1> don't send
# escapes or 2> put the vt220 into vt100 mode and use all the nifty
# features of vt100 advanced video which it then has.
#
# This entry takes the view of putting a vt220 into vt100 mode so
# you can use the escape key in emacs and everything else which needs it.
#
# You probably don't want to use this on a VMS machine since VMS will think
# it has a vt220 and will get fouled up coming out of emacs

# VT330 and VT340 -- These are ReGIS and SIXEL graphics terminals

#   host writable status line, yet another different DRCS matrix size,
#   and such, but they add the DEC Technical character set, Multiple text
#   pages, selectable length pages, and the like.  The difference between
#   the vt330 and vt340 is that the latter has only 2 planes and a monochrome
#   monitor, the former has 4 planes and a color monitor.  These terminals
#   support VT131 and ANSI block mode, but as with much of these things,
#   termcap/terminfo doesn't deal with these features.

# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU

#               else if (key < 30) then value = key + 4;
#               else value = key + 5;
#
# The string must be the hexadecimal equivalent, e.g., "5052494E" for "PRINT".
# There's no provision in terminfo for emitting a string in this format, so the

# This entry is for Tera Term Pro version 2.3, for MS-Windows 95/NT written by
# T. Teranishi dated Mar 10, 1998.  It is a free software terminal emulator
# (communication program) which supports:
#
#	- Serial port connections.
#	- TCP/IP (telnet) connections.
#	- VT100 emulation, and selected VT200/300 emulation.
#	- TEK4010 emulation.
#	- File transfer protocols (Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and
#	  Quick-VAN).
#	- Scripts using the "Tera Term Language".
#	- Japanese and Russian character sets.
#
# The program does not come with terminfo or termcap entries.  However, the
# emulation (testing with vttest and ncurses) is reasonably close to vt100 (no
# vt52 or doublesize character support; blinking is done with color).  Besides
# the HPA, VPA extensions it also implements CPL and CNL.
#
# All of the function keys can be remapped.  This description shows the default
# mapping, as installed.  Both vt100 PF1-PF4 keys and quasi-vt220 F1-F4 keys
# are supported.  F13-F20 are obtained by shifting F3-F10.  The editing keypad
# is laid out like vt220, rather than the face codes on the PC keyboard, i.e,
#	kfnd	Insert
#	kslt	Delete
#	kich1	Home
#	kdch1	PageUp
#	kpp	End
#	knp	PageDown
#
# ANSI colors are implemented, but cannot be combined with video attributes
# except for reverse.
#
# No fonts are supplied with the program, so the acsc string is chosen to
# correspond with the default Microsoft terminal font.
#
# Tera Term recognizes some xterm sequences, including those for setting and
# retrieving the window title, and for setting the window size (i.e., using
# "resize -s"), though it does not pass SIGWINCH to the application if the
# user resizes the window with the mouse.

# The "PC-style" modifier scheme was introduced in xterm patch #94 (1999/3/27)
# and revised in xterm patch #167 (2002/8/24).  Some other terminal emulators
# copied the earlier scheme, as noted in the "use=" clauses in this file.
#
# The original assignments from patch #94 for cursor-keys had some technical
# issues:
#
#	A parameter for a function-key to represent a modifier is just more
#	bits.  But for a cursor-key it may change the behavior of the
#	application.  For instance, emacs decodes the first parameter of a
#	cursor-key as a repeat count.
#
#	A parameterized string should (really) not begin with SS3 (\EO).
#	Rather, CSI (\E[) should be used.
#
# For these reasons, the original assignments were deprecated.  For
# compatibility reasons, they are still available as a setting of xterm's
# modifyCursorKeys resource.  These fragments list the modified cursor-keys
# that might apply to xterm+pcfkeys with different values of that resource.

#### XTERM Mouse
# The xterm mouse protocol is used by other terminal emulators.
# In this section, two extended capabilities are used to illustrate the mouse
# protocol: XM and xm.  The "XM" capability is recognized by ncurses to allow
# enabling/disabling other mouse protocols.  The "xm" capability describes the
# mouse response; currently there is no interpreter which would use this
# information to make the mouse support completely data-driven.

# Here is the "original" xterm mouse protocol.
#
# First seen in X10.3, February 1986, this likely dates from 1985 based on the
# copyright dates in the sources.  A comment in charproc.c notes "MIT bogus
# sequence", referring to the fact that it does not correspond to a "real"
# terminal.  The mouse responses for the X10 protocol are sent only for
# button-presses.

# Here is the conventional xterm mouse protocol, introduced with X11R1 in
# September 1987.
#
# The mouse responses for the X11 protocol covered button releases, as well as
# modifiers:
#  shift    4
#  alt/meta 8 (technically the "mod1" mask, because X11 has no such keys)
#  control 16
#
# The modifiers are not reflected in this description because as used in xterm
# they are normally inaccessible because the translations resources assign
# shift and control to other features.  However, they are important because
# they take up space in the first byte of the response.  The other bits of this
# byte are used to encode the button number for both presses and releases.
# In the X11 protocol, any button-release is encoded with "3" (the lowest 2
# bits in the byte).  Later work on XFree86 xterm used the remaining 3 bits to
# provide additional features, e.g., wheel mouse.
#
# X11R1's xterm also supported an "emacs" mouse protocol, with final character
# "t" or "T", which was activated by double-clicking.  The "t" response was
# used when the starting/ending positions were the same.
#
# X11R3 (February 1988) added the highlight/tracking mode.
#
# X11R4 (December 1989) added the control sequences document, listing the
# control sequences for the X10/X11 protocols without descriptions.  It also
# mentioned the "emacs" ("T") response.  Comments in button.c referred to the
# X11 protocol as "DEC vt200 compatible", although DEC offered no such terminal.
#
# X11R5 (November 1993) gave a description of the mouse protocol.
#
# X11R6 (January 1995) moved the control sequences document out of the xterm
# source-directory to xc/doc/specs/xterm, polishing the formatting but adding
# no new information.

# Konsole 1.0.1
# (formerly known as kvt)
#
# This program hardcodes $TERM to 'xterm', which is not accurate.  However, to
# simplify this entry (and point out why konsole isn't xterm), we base this on
# xterm-r6.  The default keyboard appears to be 'linux'.
#
# Notes:
# a) konsole implements several features from XFree86 xterm, though none of
#    that is documented - except of course in its source code - apparently
#    because its implementors are unaccustomed to reading documentation - as
#    evidenced by the sparse and poorly edited documentation distributed with
#    konsole.  Some features such as the 1049 private mode are recognized but
#    incorrectly implemented as a duplicate of the 47 private mode.
# b) even with the "vt100 (historical)" keyboard setting, the numeric keypad
#    sends PC-style escapes rather than vt100.
# c) fails vttest menu 3 (Test of character sets) because it does not properly
#    parse some control sequences.  Also fails vttest Primary Device Attributes
#    by sending a bogus code (in the source it says it's supposed to be a
#    vt220, which is doubly incorrect because it does not implement vt220
#    control sequences except for a few special cases).  Treat it as a
#    mildly-broken vt102.
#
# Update for konsole 1.3.2:
#    The 1049 private mode works (but see the other xterm screens in vttest).
#    Primary Device Attributes now returns the code for a vt100 with advanced
#    video option.  Perhaps that's intended to be a "mildly-broken vt102".
#
# Updated for konsole 1.6.4:
#    add konsole-solaris
#
# Updated for konsole 1.6.6:
#    add control-key modifiers for function-keys, etc.
#
# Updated for konsole 2.12.4:
#    add sitm/ritm
#
# vttest menu 1 shows that both konsole and gnome terminal do wrapping
# different from xterm (and vt100's).  They have the same behavior in this
# detail, but it is unclear which copies the other.

#### RXVT
# From: Thomas Dickey <dickey@clark.net> 04 Oct 1997
# Updated: Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de> 02 Nov 1997
# Notes:
# rxvt 2.21b uses
#	smacs=\E(B\E)U^N, rmacs=\E(B\E)0^O,
# but some applications don't work with that.
# It also has an AIX extension
#	box2=lqkxjmwuvtn,
# and
#	ech=\E[%p1%dX,
# but the latter does not work correctly.
#
# The distributed terminfo says it implements hpa and vpa, but they are not
# implemented correctly, using relative rather than absolute positioning.
#
# rxvt is normally configured to look for "xterm" or "xterm-color" as $TERM.
# Since rxvt is not really compatible with xterm, it should be configured as
# "rxvt" or "rxvt-color".
#
# removed dch/dch1 because they are inconsistent with bce/ech -TD
# remove km as per tack test -TD

# are rare, so this entry uses the shift- and control-modifiers as in
# xterm+pcfkeys to define keys past F12.
#
# kIC is normally not used, since rxvt performs a paste for that (shifted
# insert), unless private mode 35 is set.
#
# kDN, kDN5, kDN6, etc are extensions based on the names from xterm+pcfkeys -TD
# Removed kDN6, etc (control+shift) since rxvt does not implement this -TD

# rxvt was originally "xvt", first announced in April 1993:
#	http://www.informatica.co.cr/linux-desktops/research/1993/0416.html
#
# Though its change-log does not mention this, John Davis has stated that he
# was the author of the changes to use the bce ("new color model") which was
# incorporated into rxvt 2.11 (June 15, 1995).  The change-log does not give
# dates, nor give developer's names.  Initial color support was added for rxvt
# "2.0", which was sometime in 1994.
#
# rxvt had usable color support with 2.16 (April 2, 1996), with some help by my
# work on vttest, as well as bug reports to Mark Olesen.  For instance, the fix
# mentioned here
#	http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/6ETvLb5wHtbbzCaS4S9J
# was from one of my bug-reports -TD
#
# While the color model both for xterm and rxvt was based on Linux console,
# Olesen (or possibly Davis) diverged in one respect from Linux's bce color
# behavior: inserting/deleting characters does not fill the newly empty cell
# with the default background color.

#### MRXVT
# mrxvt 0.5.4
#
# mrxvt is based on rxvt 2.7.11, but has by default XTERM_FKEYS defined, which
# makes its function-keys different from other flavors of rxvt -TD
#
# Testing with tack:
# +	made custom description (below) to work, though it sets TERM=xterm.
#
# Testing with vttest:
# +	While "based on" rxvt, some of the basic functionality is broken.  The
#	window collapses to a single line when running several of the screens
#	in vttest, e.g., the tests for cursor movement, screen features,
#	double-sized characters.
# +	The vt52 test works properly, but this is an exception.  Due to the
#	other bug(s) most of vttest is untestable.
# +	the color test using ECH shows a gap in the bce model, like rxvt.
#
# Testing with xterm "vttest" scripts:
# +	resize.pl does not work because mrxvt does implement CSI 18 t
#	(not in rxvt, but not documented by mrxvt) but not CSI 19 t.
# +	none of the "dynamic colors" (OSC colors) scripts work.

#### SIMPLETERM
# st.suckless.org
# st-0.4.1
#
# This version uses a table which supports a single modifier (a subset of
# xterm's keys, using the same scheme).  Because it supports only a single
# modifier in this table, function keys f36-f48 are normally unavailable
# because they are assigned to modifier-4.
#
# The program assigns TERM to match the program name (the upstream source says
# "st", but Debian renames it to "stterm").
#
# The source includes two entries which are not useful here:
#	st-meta| simpleterm with meta key,
#	st-meta-256color| simpleterm with meta key and 256 colors,
# because st's notion of "meta" does not correspond to the terminfo definition.
# Rather, it acts like xterm - when the meta feature is disabled.
#
# Removed invis -TD
# Added eo, removed ul -TD
#
# Reviewed st 0.5:
# implements control-modifier, but not control-shift for special keys
# implements alt-modifier, but not alt-shift for special keys
#
# Reviewed st 0.6:
#	http://git.suckless.org/st/log/st.info
# Tmux unofficial extensions, see TERMINFO EXTENSIONS in tmux(1)
# still has no function keys past kf36 (no combinations of modifiers)
# no application keypad mode, e.g, kent.
# (Se removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)
# (Ss removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)

#### TERMINATOR
# https://code.google.com/p/jessies/
# Tested using their Debian package org.jessies.terminator 6.104.3256 on 64-bit
# Debian/current -TD (2011/8/20)
#
# There are some packaging problems:
# a) using Java, the program starts off using 50Mb, and climbs from there,
#    up to 114Mb after testing (no scrollback).
# b) it insists on reinstalling its terminal description in $HOME/.terminfo
#    (two copies, just in case the host happens to be Mac OS X).
#    I deleted this after testing with tack.
#
# Issues/features found with tack:
# a) tbc does not work (implying that hts also is broken).
#    Comparing with the tabs utility shows a problem with the last tabstop on
#    a line.
# b) has xterm-style shifted function-key strings
#    meta also is used, but control is ignored.
# c) has xterm-style modifiers for cursor keys (shift, control, shift+control,
#    meta)
# d) some combinations of shift/control send xterm-style sequences for
#    insert/delete/home/end.
# e) numeric keypad sends only numbers (compare with vttest).
# f) meta mode (km) is not implemented.
#
# Issues found with ncurses test-program:
# a) bce is inconsistently implemented
# b) widths of Unicode values above 256 do not always agree with wcwidth.
#
# Checked with vttest, found low degree of compatibility there.
#
# Checked with xterm's scripts, found that the 256-color palette is fixed.
#
# Fixes:
# a) add sgr string
# b) corrected sgr0 to reset alternate character set
# c) modified smacs/rmacs to use SCS rather than SI/SO
# d) removed bce
# e) removed km
# (sgr removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)
# (acsc removed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)
# (terminfo-only capabilities suppressed to fit entry within 1023 bytes)

#### TERMINOLOGY
# http://enlightenment.org
#
# Tested terminology-0.3.0, 0.6.1, using tack and vttest.  This is not a vt100
# emulator, nor is it compatible with xterm, but it uses a few features from
# both -TD
#
# General comments:
#	cursor does not fill on focus
#	there are pervasive problems with clearing/erasing parts of the screen
#	resizing the window causes it to stop listening to the keyboard
# tack -
#	doesn't understand vt100 CPR needed for resize
#	no CBT
#	no cvvis
#	has invis
#	no blink
#	uses bce model for colors, but (see below) fails the vttest screens
#	has partial support for 256color feature.
#	tack function-keys (a subset of xterm+pcf0), and
#	tack cursor-keys (a subset of xterm+pce2):
#			ctrl+shift (ignored)
#		2	shift
#			shift-alt modifier -> shift (2)
#		3	alt
#		4
#		5	ctrl
#	tack modifiers did not work for fkeys in 0.3.0; subset works in 0.6.1
#	ctrl + khome/kend works - none of the other modifiers do
# vttest -
#	spits lots of messages from termptyesc.c especially in vttest.
#	no 132-column mode
#	fails menu 1, 2 (definitely not vt100-compatible)
#	primary (claims vt420 with several options, apparently none work) and
#	secondary report says (perhaps... vt420): \E[>41;285;0c
#	CHA, HPR, VPA, CNL, CPL work
#	BCE with ED/EL - fail
#	BCE with ECH/indexing - fail
#	SD/SU work
#	unlike teken, background light/dark works
#	can set title
#	X10 and Normal mouse work
#	Any-event mouse works
#	Mouse button-event works
#
# This description uses xterm+pcf0, which is misleading because the program
# does not handle combinations of modifiers - but listing them all would
# involve more effort than its developers spent -TD

# Entries for use by the `screen' program by Juergen Weigert,

# come from University of Wisconsin and may be older.
# (screen: added :ve: on ANSI model -- esr)
#
# 'screen' defines extensions to termcap.  Some are used in its terminal
# description:
#      G0   (bool)  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022  font  selection sequences.
#      AX   (bool)  Does  understand ANSI set default fg/bg color
#                   (\E[39m / \E[49m).
#      S0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset.
#      E0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset.
#
# Initially tested with screen 3.09.08
#
# According to its manual page
#
#      Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
#      terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each
#      virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in
#      addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI
#      X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.  insert/delete line and support for
#      multiple character sets).
#
# However, there is a design error in its support for video highlights.  The
# program uses a table (rendlist) which equates the SGR codes to terminal
# capabilities.  That, and color-decoding are hardcoded in screen; its behavior
# is modified only by the presence or absence of the corresponding capabilities.
# Not by their values.
#
# If screen sets the TERMCAP variable, it uses hardcoded strings which
# correspond to the rendlist table.
#
# The table gives this information:
#
#	SGR	capability
#	---	---------
#	1	bold
#	2	dim
#	3	standout
#	4	underline
#	5	blink
#	-	(unused 6)
#	7	reverse
#	-	(unused 8-21)
#	22	reset bold, standout and dim
#	23	reset standout
#	24	reset underline
#	25	reset blink
#	-	(unused 26)
#	27	reset reverse
#
# ECMA-48 differs from this: 3 and 23 set and reset italics, respectively.
# ECMA-48 does not define "standout" - that is a termcap/terminfo abstraction.
# Without some redesign of screen, it is not possible to extend the set of
# capabilities.  Substitution would be possible, e.g., sending italics in
# place of underline.
#
# Because screen uses hard-coded parsing, it does not check if two capabilities
# use the same value.  For example, changing standout to be the same as any of
# the other capabilities will confuse screen.  Curses applications which use
# sgr are not impacted (because that usually resets all capabilities before

# Read the fine manpage:
#       When  screen  tries  to  figure  out  a  terminal name for
#       itself, it first looks for an entry named "screen.<term>",
#       where  <term>  is the contents of your $TERM variable.  If
#       no such entry exists, screen tries "screen" (or "screen-w"
#       if the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)).  If even this
#       entry cannot be found, "vt100" is used as a substitute.
#
# Notwithstanding the manpage, screen uses its own notion of the termcap
# and some keys from "screen.<term>" are ignored.  Here is an entry which

# + However, default-colors are incomplete: do not set bce.
# + It does not implement flash (since no \e[?5h)
# + Do not set XT: dvtm knows about OSC 0 and 2, but not 1.
#   Oddly enough, if $TERM contains "linux", it attempts to set the title.
# + Some of the program is cut/paste from rxvt-unicode, e.g., the ACS table.
# + The built-in table of function-keys (based on rxvt) is incomplete (ends
#   with kf22).
# + It also omits the shifted cursor- and editing-keypad keys.
#   However, it is confused by xterm's shifted cursor- and editing-keypad keys
#   (and passes those through without interpretation)
#   and may simply pass-through rxvt's, making it appear to work.
#   In other cases such as kf23 and up, no pass-through is done.
# + Most of the mode-settings in the initialization/reset strings are not
#   implemented; dvtm copies its description from rxvt.

# Francesco Potorti <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>:
# NCSA telnet is one of the most used telnet clients for the Macintosh.  It has
# been maintained until recently by the National Center for Supercomputer
# Applications, and it is feature rich, stable and free.  It can be downloaded
# from www.ncsa.edu.  This terminfo description file is based on xterm-vt220,
# xterm+sl, and the docs at NCSA.  It works well.
#
# NCSA Telnet 2.6 for Macintosh in vt220 8-bit emulation mode
# The terminal options should be set as follows:
#         Xterm sequences ON
#         use VT wrap mode ON
#         use Emacs arrow keys OFF
#         CTRL-COMND is Emacs meta ON
#         8 bit mode ON
#         answerback string: "ncsa-vt220-8"
#         setup keys: all disabled
#
# Application mode is not used.
#
# Other special mappings:
#	Apple		VT220
#	HELP		Find
#	HOME		Insert here
#	PAGEUP		Remove
#	DEL		Select
#	END		Prev Screen
#	PAGEDOWN	Next Screen
#
# Though it supports ANSI color, NCSA Telnet uses color to represent blinking
# text.
#
# The status-line manipulation is a mapping of the xterm-compatible control
# sequences for setting the window-title.  So you must use tsl and fsl in
# pairs, since the latter ends the string that is loaded to the window-title.

#### Microsoft (miscellaneous)

# This entry fits the Windows NT console when the _POSIX_TERM environment
# variable is set to 'on'.  While the Windows NT POSIX console is seldom used,
# the Telnet client supplied with both the Windows for WorkGroup 3.11 TCP/IP
# stack and the Win32 (i.e., Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.1 or later) operating
# systems is not, and (surprise!) they match very well.
#
# See:  MS Knowledge Base item Q108581, dated 13-MAY-1997, titled "Setting Up
# VI POSIX Editor for Windows NT 3.1".  True to Microsoft form, not only
# are the installation instructions a pile of mind-numbing bureaucratese,
# but the termcap entry is actually broken and unusable as given; the :do:
# capability is misspelled "d".
#
# To use this, you need to a bunch of environment variables:
#
# SET _POSIX_TERM=on
# SET TERM=ansi
# SET TERMCAP=location of termcap file in POSIX file format
# which is case-sensitive.
# e.g. SET TERMCAP=//D/RESKIT35/posix/termcap
# SET TMP=//C/TEMP
#
# Important note: setting the TMP environment variable in POSIX style renders
# it incompatible with a lot of other applications, including Visual C++. So
# you should have a separate command window just for vi. All the other
# variables may be permanently set in the Control Panel\System applet.
#
# You can find out more about the restrictions of this facility at
# <http://www.nentug.org/unix-to-nt/ntposix.htm>.

# Honeywell Bull terminal.  Its cursor and function keys send single
# control characters and it has standout/underline glitch.  Most programs
# do not like these features/bugs.  Visual bell is realized by flashing the

#
# These guys are long since out of the terminals business, but
# in 1995 many current terminals still have an adm type as one of their
# emulations (usually their stupidest, and usually labeled adm3, though
# these `adm3' emulations normally have adm3a+ capabilities).
#
# WARNING: Some early ADM terminals (including the ADM3 and ADM5) had a
# `diagnostic feature' that sending them a ^G while pin 22 (`Ring Indicator')
# was being held to ground would trigger a send of the top line on the screen.
# A quick fix might be to drop back to a cheesy 4-wire cable with pin 22
# hanging in the air. (Thanks to Eric Fischer, <eric@fudge.uchicago.edu>,
# for clearing up this point.)

#
# You will need to get into the supervisor setup before you can set
# baudrate etc. for your ADM-12+. Press Shift-Ctrl-Setup and you should
# see a lot more setup options.
#
# While in supervisor setup you can also use following codes:
#
# Ctrl-P Personality character selections (configure for example what
#        arrow keys send, if I recall correctly)
# Ctrl-T tabs 1-80   use left&right to move and up to set and
# Ctrl-V tabs 81-158 down to clear tab. Shift-Ctrl-M sets right margin at cursor
# Ctrl-B Binary setup (probably not needed. I think that everything can
#        be set using normal setup)
# Ctrl-A Answerback mode (enter answerback message)
# Ctrl-U User friendly mode (normal setup)
# Ctrl-D Defaults entire setup and function keys from EPROM tables
# Ctrl-S Save both setup and functions keys. Takes from 6 to 10 seconds.
# Ctrl-R Reads both setup and functions keys from NVM.
# Shift-Ctrl-X Unlock keyboard and cancel received X-OFF status
#
# ADM-12+ supports hardware handshaking, but it is DTR/CTS as opposed to
# RTS/CTS used nowadays with virtually every modem and computer. 19200
# bps works fine with hardware flow control.
#
# The following null-modem cable should fix this and enable you to use
# RTS/CTS handshaking (which Linux supports, use CRTSCTS setting). Also
# set ADM-12+ for DTR handshaking from supervisor setup.

# Qume was bought by Wyse, but still (as of early 1995) has its own support
# group and production division.
#
# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulations including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.
#
# There are some ancient printing Qume terminals under `Daisy Wheel Printers'
#
# If you inherit a Qume without docs, try Ctrl-Shift-Setup to enter its
# setup mode.  Shift-s should be a configuration save to NVRAM.

# tvi{912,920}[bc] - TeleVideo TVI-912B/TVI-920B and TVI-912C/TVI-920C
# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler
#
# Someone has put a scanned copy of the manual online at:
#     http://vt100.net/televideo/912b-om/
#
# These terminals were produced ca. 1979, and had a 12" monochrome
# screen, supported 75-9600 baud (no handshaking), monochrome, 7-bit
# ASCII, and were generally similar to adm3a but with attributes
# (including some with magic cookies), fancy half-duplex mode, and
# different bugs.
#
# Some operations require truly incredible amounts of padding. The
# insert_line (:al:) and delete_line (:dl:) operations in particular
# are so slow as to be nearly unusable.
#
# There may or may not have been a separate, earlier series of 912/920
# terminals (without the "B" and "C" suffix); I have never seen one,
# and the manual only describes the "B" and "C" series. The 912 and 920
# are quite distinct from the 914 and 924, which were much nicer non-
# magic-cookie terminals similar to the 950.
#
# This is a new description for the following TeleVideo terminals,
# distinguished chiefly by their keyboards:
#
#   TVI-912B - very odd layout, no function keys (84 keys)
#   TVI-920B - typewriter layout, no function keys (103 keys)
#   TVI-912C - very odd layout, function keys F1-F11 (82 keys)
#   TVI-920C - typewriter layout, function keys F1-F11 (101 keys)
#
# To choose a setting for the TERM variable, start with the model:
#
#    Model  || base name
# ----------||-----------
#  TVI-912B || tvi912b
#  TVI-912C || tvi912c
#  TVI-920B || tvi920b
#  TVI-920C || tvi920c
#
# Then add a suffix from the following table describing installed options
# and how you'd like to use the terminal:
#
#   Use Video | Second | Visual |  Magic  |  Page || feature
#  Attributes |  Page  |  Bell  | Cookies | Print || suffix
# ------------|--------|--------|---------|-------||---------
#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |   No  || -unk
#      No     |   No   |  N/A   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -p
#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |   No  || -2p-unk
#      No     |  Yes   |   No   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -2p-p
#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |   No  || -vb-unk
#      No     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   N/A   |  Yes  || -vb-p
#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |    No   |  N/A  ||
#     Yes     |   No   |  N/A   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -mc
#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |    No   |  N/A  || -2p
#     Yes     |  Yes   |   No   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -2p-mc
#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |    No   |  N/A  || -vb
#     Yes     |  Yes   |  Yes   |   Yes   |  N/A  || -vb-mc
#
# So e.g. a model 920 C with second page memory option, visual bell
# and no magic cookies would be tvi920c-vb; a model 912 B without the
# second page memory option and using magic cookies would be
# tvi912b-mc
#
# PADDING
#
# At 9600 baud, the terminal is prone to overflow its input buffer
# during complex operations (insert/delete
# character/line/screen/page), and it does not signal this over the
# RS232 cable. The typical symptom of an overrun is that the terminal
# starts beeping, and output becomes garbled.
#
# The padding delays in this terminfo were derived using tack(1)
# running on a Linux box connected to a TVI-920C with a later-model
# (A49C1-style) ROM running at 9600 baud, so your mileage may
# vary. The numbers below seem to give the terminal enough time so
# that it doesn't overflow its input buffer and start losing
# characters.
#
# KEYS
#
# If you want to use the FUNCT key on a tvi912[bc], use the
# corresponding tvi920[bc] terminfo with FUNCT + ... equivalents from
# the following table (these also work on the 920 series):
#
# Unshifted Function Keys:
#
#  Key | capname|| Equivalent
# -----|--------||------------
#   F1 |  :k1: || FUNCT + @
#   F2 |  :k2: || FUNCT + A

#
# NON-STANDARD CAPABILITIES
#
# Sending <u9> or <u7> returns a cursor position report in the format
# YX\r, where Y and X are as in :cm:. This format is described in
# <u8> and <u6>, but it's not clear how one should write an
# appropriate scanf string, since we need to subtract %' ' from the
# character after reading it. The <u9> capability is used by tack(1)
# to synchronize during padding tests, and seems to work for that
# purpose.
#
# This description also includes the obsolete termcap capabilities
# has_hardware_tabs (:pt:) and backspaces_with_bs (:bs:).
#
# FEATURES NOT YET DESCRIBED IN THIS TERMINFO
#
# The FUNCT modifier actually works with every normal key by sending
# ^AX\r, where X is the sequence normally sent by that key. This is a
# sort of meta key not currently describable in terminfo.
#
# There are quite a few other keys (especially on the 920 models,) but
# they are for the most part only useful in block mode.
#
# These terminals have lots of forms manipulation features, mainly
# useful in block mode, including "clear X to nulls" (vs. "clear X to
# spaces"; nulls are sentinels for "send X" operations); "send X"
# operations for uploading all or part of the screen; and block-mode
# editing keys (they don't send escape sequences, but manipulate video
# memory directly). Block mode is used for local editing, and protect
# mode (in conjunction with the "write protect" attribute,
# a.k.a. half-intensity outside of protect mode) is used to control
# which parts of the screen are edited/sent/printed (by <mc0>).
#
# There are at least two major families of ROM, "early" and
# A49B1/A49C1; the major difference seems to be that the latter ROMs
# support a few extra escape sequences for manipulating the off-screen
# memory page, and for sending whole pages back to the host (mainly
# useful in block mode.) The descriptions in this file don't use any
# of those sequences: set cursor position including page (\E-PYX,
# where P is \s for page 0 and ! for page 1 [actually only the LSB of
# P is taken into account, so e.g. 0 and 1 work too,] and Y and X are
# as in :cm:); read cursor position (\E/), which is analogous to <u9>
# and returns PYX\r, where P is \s for page 0 or ! for page 1, and YX
# are as in :cm:, and some "send page" features mainly useful for
# forms manipulation.
#
# The keyboard enable (\E") and disable (\E#) sequences are unused,
# except that a terminal reset (:is:) enables the keyboard.
#
# Auto-flip mode (\Ev) is likely faster than the scrolling mode (\Ew)
# enabled in :is:, but auto-flip is very jarring so we don't use it.
#
# BUGS
#
# At least up to the A49B1 and A49C1 ROMs, there are no \Eb and \Ed
# sequences (I infer that in some TeleVideo terminal they may invert
# and uninvert the display) so the :vb: sequence given here is a
# cheesy page-flip instead.
#
# The back_tab (:bt:) sequence (\EI) doesn't work according to
# tack(1), so it is not included in the descriptions below.
#
# It's not clear whether auto_left_margin (:bw:) flag should be set
# for these terminals; tack says yes, so it is set here, but this
# differs from other descriptions I've seen.
#
# Extension print mode (<mc5>) echoes all characters to the printer
# port [in addition to displaying them] except for the page print mode
# sequence (<mc4>); this is a slight violation of the terminfo
# definition for <mc5> but I don't expect it to cause problems.  We
# reset to page print mode in <rs1> since it may have been enabled
# accidentally.
#
# The descriptions with plus signs (+) are building blocks.

# Visual 50 from Beau Shekita, BTL-Whippany <whuxlb!ejs>
# Recently I hacked together the following termcap for Visual
# Technology's Visual 50 terminal. It's a slight modification of
# the vt52 termcap.
# It's intended to run when the Visual 50 is in vt52 emulation mode
# (I know what you're thinking; if it's emulating a vt52, then why
# another termcap? Well, it turns out that the Visual 50 can handle
# :dl: and db(?) among other things, which the vt52 can't)
# The termcap works OK for the most part. The only problem is on
# character inserts. The whole line gets painfully redrawn for each
# character typed. Any suggestions?
# Beau's entry is combined with the vi50 entry from University of Wisconsin.
# Note especially the :al: function.  :k4:-:k6: are really l4-l6 in
# disguise; :k7:-:k9: are really l1-l3.

# Wyse bought out Link Technology, Inc. in 1990 and closed it down in 1995.

#
# These entries include a few small fixes.
# I canceled the bel capacities in the vb entries.
# I made two trivial syntax fixes in the wyse30 entry.
# I made some entries relative to adm+sgr.

# Note: The wyse75, wyse85, and wyse99 have been discontinued.

#	   Although the Wyse 30 can support more than one attribute
#	it requires magic cookies to do so.  Many applications do not

#	but for true color applications it's not so hot because you cannot
#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).
#
#	The mandatory pause used by flash does not work with
#	older versions of terminfo.  If you see this effect then
#	unset xon and delete the / from the delay.
#	i.e. change $<100/> to $<100>
#
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.

#		:i1: -> select the proper font
#		:is: -> do the initialization

#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the

#	The capabilities effected are :dc: :dl: :al: :sf: :sr:

#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the

#	The Wyse 75 is a vt100 lookalike without advanced video.
#
#	   The Wyse 75 can support one attribute (e.g. Dim, Inverse,
#	Underline) without magic cookies.  The following description
#	uses this capability, but when more than one attribute is
#	put on the screen at once, all attributes will be changed
#	to be the same as the last attribute given.
#	   The Wyse 75 can support more attributes when used with magic
#	cookies.  The wy75-mc terminal description uses magic cookies
#	to correctly handle multiple attributes on a screen.

# From: Kevin Turner <kevint@aracnet.com>, 12 Jul 1998
# This copes with an apparent firmware bug in the wy85.  He writes:
# "What I did was change leave the terminal cursor keys set to Normal
# (instead of application), and change \E[ to \233 for all the keys in
# terminfo. At one point, I found some reference indicating that this
# terminal bug (not sending \E[) was acknowledged by Wyse (so it's not just
# me), but I can't find that and the server under my bookmark to "Wyse
# Technical" isn't responding.  So there's the question of whether the wy85
# terminfo should reflect the manufacturer's intended behaviour of the terminal
# or the actual."

#TITLE:  TERMINFO ENTRY WY520
#DATE:   8/5/93
# The WY520 terminfo is based on the WY285 entry published on the WYSE
# BBS with the addition of more function keys and special keys.
#
#               rs1 -> set personality
#               rs2 -> set number of columns
#               rs3 -> set number of lines
#               is1 -> select the proper font
#               is2 -> do the initialization
#               is3 -> If this string is empty then rs3 gets sent.
#
#       Wyse 520 emulating a vt420 7 bit mode with default ANSI keyboard
#       - The BS key is programmed to generate BS in smcup since
#         is2 doesn't seem to work.
#       - Remove and shift/Remove: delete a character
#       - Insert : enter insert mode
#       - Find   : delete to end of file
#       - Select : clear a line
#       - F11, F12, F13: send default sequences (not ESC, BS, LF)
#       - F14 : Home key
#       - Bottom status line (host writable line) is used.
#       - smkx,rmkx are removed because this would put the numeric
#         keypad in Dec application mode which doesn't seem to work
#         with SCO applications.

######## NON-ANSI TERMINAL EMULATIONS
#

#### Avatar
#
# These entries attempt to describe Avatar, a terminal emulation used with
# MS-DOS bulletin-board systems.  It was designed to give ANSI-like
# capabilities, but with cheaper (shorter) control sequences.  Messy design,
# excessively dependent on PC idiosyncrasies, but apparently rather popular
# in the BBS world.
#
# No color support.  Avatar doesn't fit either of the Tektronix or HP color
# models that terminfo knows about.  An Avatar color attribute is the
# low 7 bits of the IBM-PC display-memory attribute.  Bletch.
#
# I wrote these entries while looking at the Avatar spec.  I don't have
# the facilities to test them.  Let me know if they work, or don't.
#
# Avatar escapes not used by these entries (because maybe you're smarter
# and more motivated than I am and can figure out how to wrap terminfo
# around some of them, and because they are weird enough to be funny):
#				level 0:
# ^L		-- clear window/reset current attribute to default
# ^V^A%p1%c	-- set current color attribute, parameter decodes as follows:
#
#      bit:         6   5   4   3   2   1   0
#                   |       |   |   |       |
#                   +---+---+   |   +---+---+
#                       |       |       |
#                       |       |  foreground color
#                       |  foreground intensity
#                  background color
#				level 0+:
# ^V^J%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) up by p1 lines
# ^V^K%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c	-- scroll (p2,p3) to (p4,p5) down by p1 lines
# ^V^L%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c		-- clear p2 lines and p3 cols w/attr %p1
# ^V^M%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c	-- fill p3 lines & p4 cols w/char p2+attr %p1
# (^V^L and ^V^M set the current attribute as a side-effect.)
# ^V ^Y <a> [...] <c>	-- repeat pattern. <a> specifies the number of bytes
#			   in the pattern, <c> the number of times the pattern
#			   should be repeated. If either value is 0, no-op.
#			   The pattern can contain Avatar console codes,
#			   including other ^V ^Y patterns.
#				level 1:
# ^V^O		-- clockwise mode on; turn print direction right each time you
#		   hit a window edge (yes, really).  Turned off by CR
# ^V^P		-- no-op
# ^V^Q%c	-- query the driver
# ^V^R		-- driver reset
# ^V^S		-- Sound tone (PC-specific)
# ^V^T			-- change highlight at current cursor position to %c
# ^V^U%p1%c%p2%c	-- highlight window <a> with attribute <b>
# ^V^V%p1%c%p2%c%p3%c%p4%c%p5%c
#			-- define window

# (The :mb:/:md:/:mr:/:as:/:us:/:so: capabilities exist only to
# tell ncurses that the corresponding highlights exist; it should use :sa:,
# which is the only method that will actually work for multiple highlights.)
#
# Update by TD - 2004: half of this was inconsistent.  Found documentation
# and repaired most of the damage.  sgr0 is probably incorrect, but the
# available documentation gives no clues for a workable string.

#
# Matrix Orbital 20x4 LCD display
# Command Character is 0xFE (decimal 254, octal 376)
#
# On this device, cursor addressability isn't possible.  The LCD expects:
#      0xfe G <col> <row>
#      for cup: %p1 == row and %p2 is column
#
# This line:
#	cup=\376G%p2%c%p1%c
# LOOKS like it will work, but sometimes only one of the two numbers is sent.
# See the terminfo (5) manpage commented regarding 'Terminals which use "%c"'.
#
# Alas, there is no cursor upline capability on this display.
#
# These entries add some 'sanity stuff' to the clear function.  That is, it
# does a 'clear' and also turns OFF auto scroll, turns ON Auto Line Wrapping,
# and turns off the cursor blinking and stuff like that.
#
# NOTE: calling 'beep' turns on the backlight (bell)
# NOTE: calling 'flash' turns it on and back off (visual bell)

# Teletype Model 5420 -- A souped up 5410, with multiple windows,

# this terminfo should work in scroll or window mode, but doesn't
# take advantage of any of the differences between them.
#
# Has memory below (2 lines!)
# 3 pages of memory (plus some spare)
# The 5410 sequences for :cm:, :vs:, :DC:, :DL:, :ec:, :vb:, :ho:,
# <hpa>, :st: would work for these, but these work in both scroll and window
# mode... Unset insert character so insert mode works
# :i1: sets 80 column mode,
# :is: escape sequence:
# 1) turn off all fonts
# 2) function keys off, keyboard lock off, control display off,
#    insert mode off, erasure mode off,
# 3) full duplex, monitor mode off, send graphics off, nl on lf off
# 4) reset origin mode
# 5) set line wraparound
# 6) exit erasure mode, positional attribute mode, and erasure extent mode
# 7) clear margins
# 8) program ENTER to transmit ^J,
# We use \212 to program the ^J because a bare ^J will get translated by
# UNIX into a CR/LF. The enter key is needed for AT&T uOMS.

# This is the att700 entry for 700 native emulation of the AT&T 700
# terminal.  Comments are relative to changes from the 605V2 entry and
# att730 on which the entry is based.  Comments show the terminfo
# capability name, termcap name, and description.
#
# Here is what's going onm in the init string:
#	ESC [ 50;4|	set 700 native mode (really is 605)
# x	ESC [ 56;ps|	set lines to 24: ps=0; 40: ps=1 (plus status line)
#	ESC [ 53;0|	set GenFlow to Xon/Xoff
#	ESC [ 8 ;0|	set CR on NL
# x	ESC [ ? 3 l/h	set workspace: 80 col(l); 132 col(h)
#	ESC [ ? 4 l	jump scroll
#	ESC [ ? 5 l/h	video: normal (l); reverse (h)
#	ESC [ ?13 l	Labels on
#	ESC [ ?15 l	parity check = no
#	ESC [ 13 l	monitor mode off
#	ESC [ 20 l	LF on NL (not CRLF on NL)
#	ESC [ ? 7 h	autowrap on
#	ESC [ 12 h	local echo off
#	ESC ( B		GO = ASCII
#	ESC ) 0		G1 = Special Char & Line Drawing
#	ESC [ ? 31 l	Set 7 bit controls
#
# Note: Most terminals, especially the 600 family use Reverse Video for
# standout mode.  DEC also uses reverse video.  The VT100 uses bold in addition
# Assume we should stay with reverse video for 70..  However, the 605V2 exits
# standout mode with \E[m (all normal attributes).  The 730 entry simply
# exits reverse video which would leave other current attributes intact.  It
# was assumed the 730 entry to be more correct so rmso has changed.  The
# 605V2 has no sequences to turn individual attributes off, thus its setting
# and the rmso/smso settings from the 730.
#
# Note: For the same reason as above in rmso I changed exit under-score mode
# to specifically turn off underscore, rather than return to all normal
# attributes
#
# Note: The following pkey_xmit is taken from the 605V2 which contained the
# capability as pfxl.  It was changed here to pfx since pfxl
# will only compile successfully with Unix 4.0 tic.  Also note that pfx only
# allows strings to be parameters and label values must be programmed as
# constant strings.  Supposedly the pfxl of Version 4.0 allows both labels
# and strings to be parameters.  The 605V2 pfx entry should be examined later
# in this regard. For reference the 730 pfxl entry is shown here for comparison
# 730 pfx entry:

#### Ann Arbor (aa)
#
# Ann Arbor made dream terminals for hackers -- large screen sizes and huge
# numbers of function keys.  At least some used monitors in portrait mode,
# allowing up to 76-character screen heights!  They were reachable at:
#
#	Ann Arbor Terminals
#	6175 Jackson Road
#	Ann Arbor, MI 48103
#	(313)-663-8000
#
# But in 1996 the phone number reaches some kitschy retail shop, and Ann Arbor
# can't be found on the Web; I fear they're long dead.  R.I.P.
#


# Originally from Mike O'Brien@Rand and Howard Katseff at Bell Labs.
# Highly modified 6/22 by Mike O'Brien.
# split out into several for the various screen sizes by dave-yost@rand
# Modifications made 3/82 by Mark Horton
# Modified by Tom Quarles at UCB for greater efficiency and more diversity
# status line moved to top of screen, :vb: removed 5/82
# Some unknown person at SCO then hacked the init strings to make them more
# efficient.
#
# assumes the following setup:
#   A menu: 0000 1010  0001 0000
#   B menu: 9600  0100 1000  0000 0000  1000 0000  17  19

#
#	Briefly, the settings are for the following modes:
#	   (values are for bit set/clear with * indicating our preference
#	    and the value used to test these termcaps)
#	Note that many of these settings are irrelevant to the terminfo
#	and are just set to the default mode of the terminal as shipped
#	by the factory.

# ADDS itself is long gone.  ADDS was bought by NCR, and the same group made
# ADDS and NCR terminals.  When AT&T and NCR merged, the engineering for
# terminals was merged again.  Then AT&T sold the terminal business to
# SunRiver, which later changed its  name to Boundless Technologies.  The
# engineers from Teletype, AT&T terminals, ADDS, and NCR (who are still there
# as of early 1995) are at:

#	Fax: (516)-342-7378

# From: David S. Lawyer, June 1997:
# The CIT 101-e was made in Japan in 1983-4 and imported by CIE
# Terminals in Irvine, CA.  It was part of CITOH Electronics.  In the
# late 1980's CIT Terminals went out of business.
# There is no need to use the initialization string is=... (by invoking
# tset or setterm etc.) provided that the terminal has been manually set
# up (and the setup saved with ^S) to be compatible with this termcap.  To be
# compatible it should be in ANSI mode (not VT52).   A set-up that
# works is to set all the manually settable stuff to factory defaults
# by pressing ^D in set-up mode.  Then increase the brightness with the
# up-arrow key since the factory default will likely be dim on an old
# terminal.  Then change any options you want (provided that they are

#### Getronics
#
# Getronics is a Dutch electronics company that at one time was called
# `Geveke' and made async terminals; but (according to the company itself!)
# they've lost all their documentation on the command set.  The hardware
# documentation suggests the terminals were actually manufactured by a
# Taiwanese electronics company named Cal-Comp.  There are known
# to have been at least two models, the 33 and the 50.
#

# The 50 seems to be a top end vt220 clone, with the addition of a higher
# screen resolution, a larger screen, at least 1 page of memory above and
# below the screen, apparently pages of memory right and left of the screen
# which can be panned, and about 75 function keys (15 function keys x normal,
# shift, control, func A, func B). It also has more setup possibilities than
# the vt220. The monitor case is dated November 1978 and the keyboard case is
# May 1982.
#
# The vt100 emulation works as is.  The entry below describes the rather
# non-conformant (but more featureful) ANSI mode.
#
# From: Stephen Peterson <stv@utrecht.ow.nl>, 27 May 1995

# Extensive changes to c108 by arpavax:eric Feb 1982
# Some unknown person at SCO then translated it to terminfo.
#
# There seem to be a number of different versions of the C108 PROMS
# (with bug fixes in its Z-80 program).
#
# The first one that we had would lock out the keyboard of you
# sent lots of short lines (like /usr/dict/words) at 9600 baud.
# Try that on your C108 and see if it sends a ^S when you type it.
# If so, you have an old version of the PROMs.
#
# You should configure the C108 to send ^S/^Q before running this.
# It is much faster (at 9600 baud) than the c100 because the delays
# are not fixed.
# new status line display entries for c108-8p:
# :i3: - init str #3 - setup term for status display -
# set programmer mode, select window 2, define window at last
# line of memory, set bkgnd stat mesg there, select window 0.
#
# :ts: - to status line - select window 2, home cursor, erase to
# end-of-window, 1/2 bright on, goto(line#0, col#?)
#
# :fs: - from status line - 1/2 bright off, select window 0
#
# :ds: - disable status display - set bkgnd status mesg with
# illegal window #
#
# There are probably more function keys that should be added but
# I don't know what they are.
#
# No delays needed on c108 because of ^S/^Q handshaking

# Concept 100:
# These have only window relative cursor addressing, not screen
# relative. To get it to work right here, smcup/rmcup (which
# were invented for the concept) lock you into a one page
# window for screen style programs.
#
# To get out of the one page window, we use a clever trick:
# we set the window size to zero ("\Ev    " in rmcup) which the
# terminal recognizes as an error and resets the window to all
# of memory.
#
# This trick works on c100 but does not on c108, sigh.
#
# Some tty drivers use cr3 for concept, others use nl3, hence
# the delays on cr and ind below. This padding is only needed at
# 9600 baud and up.  One or the other is commented out depending on
# local conventions.
#
# 2 ms padding on :te: isn't always enough. 6 works fine. Maybe
# less than 6 but more than 2 will work.
#
# Note: can't use function keys f7-f10 because they are
# indistinguishable from arrow keys (!), also, del char and
# clear eol use xon/xoff so they probably won't work very well.
#
# Also note that we don't define insrt/del char/delline/eop/send
# because they don't transmit unless we reset them - I figured
# it was a bad idea to clobber their definitions.
#
# The <mc5> sequence changes the escape character to ^^ so that
# escapes will be passed through to the printer. Only trouble
# is that ^^ won't be - ^^ was chosen to be unlikely.
# Unfortunately, if you're sending raster bits through to be
# plotted, any character you choose will be likely, so we lose.
#
# \EQ"\EY(^W (send anything from printer to host, for xon/xoff)
# cannot be # in is2 because it will hang a c100 with no printer
# if sent twice.

#	All Fkeys are set to their default transmit definitions with \E[90;3u

#	setting MUST be redefined or deactivated, because the default is
#	contained in almost all of this terminal's Fkey strings!  If for some
#	reason "quit" cannot be altered, the Fkeys can, but it would be
#	necessary to change ^| to ^] in all of these definitions, and add
#	\E[2;029!t to is2.
# lines: is set to 24 because this terminal refuses to treat the 25th
#	line normally.
# ll:	Not available in power on mode, but turned on with \E[=107;207h in
#	is2=.
# lm:	Pointless, given that this definition locks a single screen of
#	memory into view, but what the hey...
# rmso: Could use \E[1;7!{ to turn off only bold and reverse (leaving any
#	other attributes alone), but some programs expect this to turn off
#	everything.
# rmul: Could use \E[4!{ to turn off only underline (leaving any other
#	attributes alone), but some programs expect this to turn off
#	everything.
# sgr:	Attributes are set on this terminal with the string \E[ followed by
#	a list of attribute code numbers (in decimal, separated by
#	semicolons), followed by the character m.  The attribute code
#	numbers are:
#		  1 for bold;
#		  2 for dim (which is ignored in power on mode);
#		  4 for underline;
#		  5 for blinking;
#		  7 for inverse;
#		  8 for not displayable; and
#		=99 for protected (except that there are strange side
#		effects to protected characters which make them inadvisable).
#	 The mapping of terminfo parameters to attributes is as follows:
#		%p1 (standout) = bold and inverse together;
#		%p2 (underline) = underline;
#		%p3 (reverse) = inverse;
#		%p4 (blink) = blinking;
#		%p5 (dim) is ignored;
#		%p6 (bold) = bold;
#		%p7 (invisible) = not displayable;
#		%p8 (protected) is ignored; and
#		%p9 (alt char set) = alt char set.
#	 The code to do this is:
#		\E[0		OUTPUT	\E[0
#		%?%p1%p6%O	IF	(standout; bold) OR
#		%t;1		THEN	OUTPUT	;1
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p2		IF	underline
#		%t;4		THEN	OUTPUT	;4
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p4		IF	blink
#		%t;5		THEN	OUTPUT	;5
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p1%p3%O	IF	(standout; reverse) OR
#		%t;7		THEN	OUTPUT	;7
#		%;		ENDIF
#		%?%p7		IF	invisible
#		%t;8		THEN	OUTPUT	;8
#		%;		ENDIF
#		m		OUTPUT	m
#		%?%p9		IF	altcharset
#		%t^N		THEN	OUTPUT	^N
#		%e^O		ELSE	OUTPUT	^O
#		%;		ENDIF
# sgr0: Everything is turned off (including alternate character set), since
#	there is no way of knowing what it is that the program wants turned
#	off.
# smul: The "underline" attribute is reconfigurable to an overline or
#	strike-through, or (as done with \E[;3+} in is2=), to a line at the true
#	bottom of the character cell.  This was done to allow for more readable
#	underlined characters, and to be able to distinguish between an
#	underlined space, an underscore, and an underlined underscore.
# xenl: Terminal can be configured to not need this, but this "glitch"
#	behavior is actually preferable with autowrap terminals.
#
# Parameters kf31= thru kf53= actually contain the strings sent by the shifted
# Fkeys.  There are no parameters for shifted Fkeys in terminfo.  The is2
# string modifies the 'O' in kf43 to kf46 to a '$'.
#
# kcbt was originally ^I but redefined in is2=.
# kHOM was \E[H originally but redefined in is2=, as were a number of
# other keys.
# kDC was originally \177 but redefined in is2=.
#
# kbs:	Shift was also ^H originally but redefined as \E$^H in is2=.
# tsl:	Go to window 2, then do an hpa=.

# There are two ways to flash the screen, both of which have their drawbacks.
# The first is to set the bell mode to video, transmit a bell character, and
# set the bell mode back - but to what?  There is no way of knowing what the
# user's old bell setting was before we messed with it.  Worse, the command to
# set the bell mode also sets the key click volume, and there is no way to say
# "leave that alone", or to know what it's set to, either.
# The second way to do a flash is to set the screen to inverse video, pad for a
# tenth of a second, and set it back - but like before, there's no way to know
# that the screen wasn't ALREADY in inverse video, or that the user may prefer
# it that way.  The point is moot anyway, since vi (and probably other
# programs) assume that by defining flash=, you want the computer to use it
# INSTEAD of bel=, rather than as a secondary type of signal.

#	 therefore needs mc5i: specified to say so) and "auxiliary print"
#	 (which does duplicate printed data on the screen, in which case mc4=
#	 and mc5= should use the \E[?4i and \E[?5i strings instead).

#### Data General (dg)
#
# According to James Carlson <carlson@xylogics.com> writing in January 1995,
# the terminals group at Data General was shut down in 1991; all these
# terminals have thus been discontinued.
#
# DG terminals have function keys that respond to the SHIFT and CTRL keys,
# e.g., SHIFT-F1 generates a different code from F1.  To number the keys
# sequentially, first the unmodified key codes are listed as F1 through F15.
# Then their SHIFT versions are listed as F16 through F30, their CTRL versions
# are listed as F31 through F45, and their CTRL-SHIFT versions are listed as
# F46 through F60.  This is done in the private "includes" below whose names
# start with "dgkeys+".
#
# DG terminals generally support 8 bit characters.  For each of these terminals
# two descriptions are supplied:
#	1) A default description for 8 bits/character communications, which
#	   uses the default DG international character set and keyboard codes.
#	2) A description with suffix "-7b" for 7 bits/character communications.
#	   This description must use the NON-DEFAULT native keyboard language.

# Unmodified fkeys (kf1-kf11), Shift fkeys (kf12-kf22), Ctrl fkeys (kf23-kf33),
# Ctrl/Shift fdkeys (kf34-kf44).

#### Harris (Beehive)
#
# Bletch.  These guys shared the Terminal Brain Damage laurels with Hazeltine.
# Their terminal group is ancient history now (1995) though the parent
# company is still in business.
#

# Beehive documentation is undated and marked Preliminary and has no figures
# so we must have early Superbee2 (Model 600, according to phone conversation
# with mfr.). It has proved reliable except for some missing padding
# (notably after \EK and <nl> at bottom of screen).
#
# The key idea is that AEP mode is poison for :cm: & that US's in
# the local memory should be avoided like the plague. That means
# that the 2048 character local buffer is used as 25 lines of 80
# characters, period. No scrolling local memory, folks. It also
# appears that we cannot use naked INS LINE feature since it uses
# US. The sbi fakes :al: with an 80-space insert that may be too
# slow at low speeds; also spaces get converted to \040 which is
# too long for some programs (not vi).  DEL LINE is ok but slow.
#
# The <nl> string is designed for last line of screen ONLY; cup to
# 25th line corrects the motion inherent in scrolling to Page 1.
#
# There is one understood bug. It is that the screen appears to
# pop to a new (blank) page after a :nw:, or leave a half-line
# ellipsis to a quad that is the extra 48 memory locations. The
# data received is dumped into memory but not displayed.  Not to
# worry if :cm: is being used; the lines not displayed will be,
# whenever the cursor is moved up there. Since :cm: is addressed
# relative to MEMORY of window, nothing is lost; but beware of
# relative cursor motion (:up:,:do:,:nd:,:le:). Recommended,
# therefore, is setenv MORE -c .
#
# WARNING: Not all features tested.
#
# Timings are assembled from 3 sources. Some timings may reflect
# SB2/Model 300 that were used if more conservative.
# Tested on a Model 600 at 1200 and 9600 bd.
#
# The BACKSPACEkb option is cute. The NEWLINE key, so cleverly
# placed on the keyboard and useless because of AEP, is made
# into a backspace key. In use ESC must be pressed twice (to send)
# and sending ^C must be prefixed by ESC to avoid that weird
# transmit mode associated with ENTER key.
#
# IF TERMINAL EVER GOES CATATONIC with the cursor buzzing across
# the screen, then it has dropped into ENTER mode; hit
# RESET--ONLINE--!tset.
#
# As delivered this machine has a FATAL feature that will throw
# it into that strange transmit state (SPOW) if the space bar is
# hit after a CR is received, but before receiving a LF (or a
# few others).
#
# The circuits MUST be modified to eliminate the SPOW latch.
# This is done by strapping on chip A46 of the I/O board; cut
# the p.c. connection to Pin 5 and strap Pin 5 to Pin 8 of that
# chip. This mod has been checked out on a Mod 600 of Superbee II.
# With this modification absurdly high timings on cr are
# unnecessary.
#
# NOTE WELL that the rear panel switch should be set to CR/LF,
# not AEP!

#### Hazeltine
#
# Hazeltine appears to be out of the terminal business as of 1995.  These
# guys were co-owners of the Terminal Brain Damage Hall Of Fame along with
# Harris. They have a hazeltine.com domain (but no web page there ) and can
# be reached at:
#
#	Hazeltine
#	450 East Pulaski Road
#	Greenlawn, New York 11740
#
# As late as 1993, manuals for the terminal product line could still be
# purchased from:
#
#	TRW Customer Service Division
#	15 Law Drive
#	P.O. Box 2076
#	Fairfield, NJ 07007-2078
#
# They're now (1998) a subsidiary of General Electric, operating under the
# marque "GEC-Marconi Hazeltine" and doing military avionics.  Web page
# at <http://www.gec.com/cpd/1ncpd.htm#1.55>.
#

# Since :nd: is blank, when you want to erase something you
# are out of luck.  You will have to do ^L's a lot to
# redraw the screen.  h1000 is untested.  It doesn't work in
# vi - this terminal is too dumb for even vi.  (The code is
# there but it isn't debugged for this case.)

# Kimtron ABM 85H added by Dual Systems.
# Some notes about the abm85h entries:
# 1) there are several firmware revs of 85H in the world. Use abm85h-old for
#    firmware revs prior to SP51
# 2) Make sure to use abm85h entry if the terminal is in 85h mode and the
#    abm85e entry if it is in tvi920 emulation mode. They are incompatible
#    in some places and NOT software settable i.e., :is: can't fix it)
# 3) In 85h mode, the arrow keys and special functions transmit when
#    the terminal is in dup-edit, and work only locally in local-edit.
#    Vi won't swallow `del char' for instance, but :ti: turns on
#    dup-edit anyway so that the arrow keys will work right. If the
#    arrow keys don't work the way you like, change :ti:, :te:, and
#    :is:.  Note that 920E mode does not have software commands to toggle
#    between dup and local edit, so you get whatever was set last on the
#    terminal.
# 4) :vb: attribute is nice, but seems too slow to work correctly
#    (\Eb:pc:\Ed)
# 5) Make sure `hidden' attributes are selected. If `embedded' attributes
#    are selected, the <xmc@> entry should be removed.
# 6) auto new-line should be on (selectable from setup mode only)

#### Microdata/MDIS
#
# This was a line of terminals made by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems.
# These entries come direct from MDIS documentation.  I have edited them only
# to move primary names of the form p[0-9] * to aliases, and to comment out
# :ae:/:as: in a couple of entries without <acsc> strings.  I have
# also removed the change history; the last version indicates this is
# version 4.3 by A.Barkus, September 1990 (earliest entry is October 1989).
#

# McDonnell Information Systems Terminal Family History
# =========================================
#
# Prism-1, Prism-2 and P99:
#       Ancient Microdata and CMC terminals, vaguely like Adds Regent 25.
#
# Prism-4 and Prism-5:
#       Slightly less ancient range of Microdata terminals. Follow-on from
#       Prism-2, but with many enhancements. P5 has eight display pages.
#
# Prism-6:
#       A special terminal for use with library systems, primarily in Germany.
#       Limited numbers. Similar functionality to P5 (except attributes?).
#
# Prism-7, Prism-8 and Prism-9:
#       More recent range of MDIS terminals, in which P7 and P8
#       replace the P4 & P5, with added functionality, and P9 is the flagship.
#       The P9 has two emulation modes - P8 and ANSI - and includes a
#       large number of the DEC VT220 control sequences. Both
#       P8 and P9 support 80c/24ln/8pg and 132cl/24li/4pg formats.
#
# Prism-12 and Prism-14:
#       Latest range, functionally very similar to the P9.  The P14 has a
#       black-on-white overscanning screen.
#
# The terminfo definitions given here are:
#
# p2      - Prism-2 (or Prism-1 or P99).
#
# p4      - Prism-4 (and older P7s & P8s).
# p5      - Prism-5 (or Prism-6).
#
# p7      - Prism-7.
# p8      - Prism-8 (in national or multinational mode).
# p8-w    - 132 column version of p8.
# p9      - Prism-9 in ANSI mode.
# p9-w    - 132 column version of p9.
# p9-8    - Prism-9 in Prism-8 emulation mode.
# p9-8-w  - As p9-8, but with 132 columns.
#
# p12     - Prism-12 in ANSI mode.
# p12-w   - 132 column version of p12.
# p12-m   - Prism-12 in MDC emulation mode.
# p12-m-w - As p12-m, but with 132 columns.
# p14     - Prism-14 in ANSI mode.
# p14-w   - 132 column version of p14.
# p14-m   - Prism-14 in MDC emulation mode.
# p14-m-w - As p14-m, but with 132 columns.
#
# p2: Prism-2
# -----------
#
# Includes Prism-1 and basic P99 without SP or MP loaded.
# The simplest form of Prism-type terminal.
# Basic cursor movement and clearing operations only.
# No video attributes.
# Notes:
#  Horizontal cursor qualifiers of NUL, XON and XOFF are mapped to the next
#  value up, followed by backspace.

# Notes:
#  Tabs only reset by "reset". Otherwise assumes default (8 cols).
#  Fixes to deal with terminal firmware bugs:
#  . 'ri' uses insert-line since rev index doesn't always
#  . 'sgr0' has extra '0' since esc[m fails
#  . 'fsl' & 'dsl' use illegal char since cr is actioned wrong on line 25
#  Not covered in the current definition:
#  . Labels
#  . Programming Fn keys
#  . Graphic characters (defaults correctly to vt100)
#  . Padding values (sets xon)

#### NCR

# NCR's terminal group was merged with AT&T's when AT&T bought the company.
# For what happened to that group, see the ADDS section.
#
# There is an NCR4103 terminal that's just a re-badged Wyse-50.
#

# The following vendor-supplied termcaps were captured from the Boundless
# Technologies site, 8 March 1998.  I removed all-upper-case names that were
# identical, except for case, to lower-case ones.  I also uncommented the acsc
# capabilities.X
#

# This terminfo file contains color capabilities for the Wyse325 emulation of
# the NCR 2900/260C color terminal.  Because of the structure of the command
# (escape sequence) used to set color attributes, one of the fore/background
# colors must be preset to a given value. I have set the background color to
# black.  The user can change this setup by altering the last section of the
# 'setf' definition.  The escape sequence to set color attributes is
#		ESC d y <foreground_color> <background_color> 1
# In addition, the background color can be changed through the desk accessories.
# The capability 'op' sets colors to green on black (default combination).
#
# NOTE:  The NCR Unix System Administrator's Shell will not function properly
#	    if the 'pairs' capability is defined. Un-Comment the 'pairs'
#	    capability and recompile if you wish to have it included.

# Newbury Data Recording Limited (Newbury Data)
#
# Have been manufacturing and reselling  various peripherals for a long time
# They don't make terminals anymore, but are still in business (in 2007).
# Their e-mail address is at ndsales@newburydata.co.uk
# and their post address is:
#
# Newbury Data Recording Ltd,
# Premier Park, Road One,
# Winsford, Cheshire, CW7 3PT
#
# Their technical support is still good, they sent me for free a printed copy
# of the 9500 user manual and I got it just 1 week after I first contacted them
# (in 2005)!

# NDR 9500
# Manufactured in the early/mid eighties, behaves almost the same as a
# Televideo 950.  Take a 950, change its cabinet for a more 80s-ish one (but
# keep the same keyboard layout), add an optional 25-line mode, replace the DIP
# switches with a menu and remove the "lock line" feature (ESC !  1 and ESC !
# 2), here is the NDR 9500.  Even the line-lock, albeit disabled, is
# recognized:  if you type in "ESC !", the next (third) character is not
# echoed, showing that the terminal was actually waiting for a parameter!

# to something that unix will accept (my delete-char is a ctrl-t, etc),
# and create some functions (like cm), but thats life.
#	The problem is with the arrow keys - right, and up work fine, but
# left deletes the previous character and down I just can't figure out.
# Jove knows what I want, but I don't know what it's sending to me (it
# isn't thats bound to next-line in jove).
#	Anybody got any ideas? Here's my termcap.
# DAG -- I changed his "^n" entries to "\n"; see if that works.

#### Console types for obsolete UNIX clones
#
# Coherent, Minix, Venix, and several lesser-known kin were OSs for 8088
# machines that tried to emulate the UNIX look'n'feel.  Coherent and Venix
# were commercial, Minix an educational tool sold in conjunction with a book.
# Memory-segmentation limits and a strong tendency to look like V7 long after
# it was obsolete made all three pretty lame.  Venix croaked early.  Coherent
# and Minix were ported to 32-bit Intel boxes, only to be run over by a
# steamroller named `Linux' (which, to be fair, traces some lineage to Minix).
# Coherent's vendor, the Mark Williams Company, went belly-up in 1994.  There
# are also, I'm told, Minix ports that ran on Amiga and Atari machines and
# even as single processes under SunOS and the Macintosh OS.

# The MAI Basic Four computer was obsolete at the end of the 1980s.
# It may be used as a terminal by putting it in "line" mode as seen on
# one of the status lines.
# Initialization is similar to CIT80. :is: will set ANSI mode for you.
# Hardware tabs set by :if: at 8-spacing.  Auto line wrap causes glitches so
# wrap mode is reset by :vs:.  Using :sf:=\E[S caused errors so I
# used \ED instead.

#### Bell Labs blit terminals
#
# These were AT&T's official entries.  The 5620 FAQ maintained by
# David Breneman <daveb@dgtl.com> has this to say:
#
#  Actually, in the beginning was the Jerq, and the Jerq was white with a
#  green face, and Locanthi and Pike looked upon the Jerq and said the Jerq
#  was good.  But lo, upon the horizon loomed a mighty management-type person
#  (known now only by the initials VP) who said, the mighty Jerq must stay
#  alone, and could not go forth into the world. So Locanthi and Pike put the
#  Jerq to sleep, cloned its parts, and the Blit was brought forth unto the
#  world. And the Jerq lived the rest of its days in research, but never
#  strayed from those paths.
#
#  In all seriousness, the Blit was originally known as the Jerq, but when
#  it started to be shown outside of the halls of the Bell Labs Research
#  organization, the management powers that be decided that the name could
#  not remain. So it was renamed to be Blit. This was in late 1981.
#
# (The AT&T 5620 was the commercialized Blit.  Its successors were the 630,
# 730, and 730+.)

# The BitGraph was a product of the now-defunct BBN Computer Corporation.
# The parent company, best known as the architects of the Internet, is
# still around.
#
# Jeff DelPapa <dp@world.std.com> writes:
# The bitgraph was a large white box that contained a monochrome bitmap
# display, and a 68000 to run it.  You could download code and run it on
# the cpu, it had 128kb (I think) of memory.  I used one in the late
# 70's, sure beat a vt100.  It had one strange feature tho -- it used
# the cpu to bitblt pixels to scroll, it took longer than the refresh
# rate, and looked like a rubber sheet stretching, then snapping
# upwards.  It had everything the early mac had, except a floppy drive a
# small screen (it had a 17" crisp beauty) and a real OS. They (Bolt
# Beranek and Neuman) sold at most a few hundred of them to the real
# world.  DOD may have bought more...
#

# Entries for the BitGraph terminals.  The problem
# with scrolling in vi can only be fixed by getting BBN to put
# smarter scroll logic in the terminal or changing vi or padding
# scrolls with about 500 ms delay.
#
# I always thought the problem was related to the terminal
# counting newlines in its input buffer before scrolling and
# then moving the screen that much. Then vi comes along and
# paints lines in on the bottom line of the screen, so you get
# this big white gap.

# From: Jan Willem Stumpel <jw.stumpel@inter.nl.net>, 11 May 1997
# The Datapoint 8242 Workstation was sold at least between 1985
# and 1989. To make the terminal work with this entry, press
# CONTROL-INT-INT to take the terminal off-line, and type (opt).
# Set the options AUTO ROLL, ROLL DN, and ESC KBD on, and AUTO
# CR/LF off. Use control-shift-[] as escape key, control-I as tab,
# shift-F1 to shift-F5 as F6 to F10 (unshifted F1 to F5 are in
# fact unusable because the strings sent by the terminal conflict
# with other keys).
# The terminal is capable of displaying "box draw" characters.
# For each graphic character you must send 2 ESC's (\E\E) followed
# by a control character as follows:
#         character        meaning
#         =========        =======

# Tim tells us that:
# I have an old Zenith-19 terminal at home that still gets a lot of use.
# This terminal suffers from the same famous insert-mode padding lossage
# that has been acknowledged for the Z29 terminal.  Emacs is nearly
# unusable on this box, since even a half-scroll up or down the window
# causes flaming terminal death.
#
# On the Z19, the only way I have found around this problem is to remove
# the :al: and :dl: entries entirely.  No amount of extra padding will
# help (I have tried up to 20000).  Removing :al=\EL$: and :dl=\EM$:
# makes Emacs a little slower, but it remains in the land of the living.
# Big win.

# The major problem with the Z29 is that it requires more padding than the Z19.
#
# The problem with declaring an H19 to be synonymous with a Z29 is that
# it needs more padding. It especially loses if a program attempts
# to put the Z29 into insert mode and insert text at 9600 baud. It
# even loses worse if the program attempts to insert tabs at 9600
# baud. Adding padding to text that is inserted loses because in
# order to make the Z29 not die, one must add so much padding that
# whenever the program tries to use insert mode, the effective
# rate is about 110 baud.
#
# What program would want to put the terminal into insert mode
# and shove stuff at it at 9600 baud you ask?
#
# Emacs. Emacs seems to want to do the mathematically optimal
# thing in doing a redisplay rather than the practical thing.
# When it is about to output a line on top of a line that is
# already on the screen, instead of just killing to the end of
# the line and outputting the new line, it compares the old line
# and the new line and if there are any similarities, it
# constructs the new line by deleting the text on the old line
# on the terminal that is already there and then inserting new
# text into the line to transform it into the new line that is
# to be displayed. The Z29 does not react kindly to this.
#
# But don't cry for too long.... There is a solution. You can make
# a termcap entry for the Z29 that says the Z29 has no insert mode.
# Then Emacs cannot use it. "Oh, no, but now inserting into a
# line will be really slow", you say. Well there is a sort of a
# solution to that too. There is an insert character option on
# the Z29 that will insert one character. Unfortunately, it
# involves putting the terminal into ansi mode, inserting the
# character, and changing it back to H19 mode. All this takes 12
# characters. Pretty expensive to insert one character, but it
# works. Either Emacs doesn't try to use its inserting hack when
# it's only given an insert character ability or the Z29 doesn't
# require padding with this (the former is probably more likely,
# but I haven't checked it out).

# Modgraph from Nancy L. Cider <nancyc@brl-tbd>
# BUG NOTE from Barbara E. Ringers <barb@brl-tbd>:
# If we set TERM=vt100, and set the Modgraph screen to 24 lines, setting a
# mark and using delete-to-killbuffer work correctly.  However, we would
# like normal mode of operation to be using a Modgraph with 48 line setting.
# If we set TERM=mod (which is a valid entry in termcap with 48 lines)
# the setting mark and delete-to-killbuffer results in the deletion of only
# the line the mark is set on.
# We've discovered that the delete-to-killbuffer works correctly
# with TERM=mod and screen set to 80x48 but it's not obvious.  Only
# the first line disappears but a ctrl-l shows that it did work
# correctly.

# The following SET-UP modes are assumed for normal operation:
#	UNDERLINE_CURSOR	ANSI_MODE	AUTO_XON/XOFF_ON
#	NEWLINE_OFF		80_COLUMNS
# Other SET-UP modes may be set for operator convenience or communication
# requirements; I recommend
#	SMOOTH_SCROLL	AUTO_REPEAT_ON	3_#_SHIFTED	WRAP_AROUND_ON
# Hardware tabs are assumed to be every 8 columns; they can be set up by the
# "reset", "tset", or "tabs" utilities (use rt6221-w, 160 columns, for this).
# Note that the Control-E key is useless on this brain-damaged terminal.  No

# As you may recall, the Soroc logo consisted of their name,

# consisted of a circle with a slightly smaller 15 degree (approx.)
# wedge with rounded corners inside it.   The color was sort of
# a metallic gold/yellow.
#
# If I had been more of a beer drinker it might have been obvious
# to me, but it took a clue from their service department to make
# me exclaim, "Of course!"   The circular object was the top of
# a beer can (the old removable pop-top style) and "Soroc" was an
# anagram for "Coors".

#### Synertek

# Bob Manson <manson@pattyr.acs.ohio-state.edu> writes (28 Apr 1995):
#
# Synertek used to make ICs, various 6502-based single-board process
# control and hobbyist computers, and assorted peripherals including a
# series of small inexpensive terminals (I think they were one of the
# first to have a "terminal-on-a-keyboard", where the terminal itself
# was only slightly larger than the keyboard).
#
# They apparently had a KTM-1 model, which I've never seen. The KTM-2/40
# was a 40x24 terminal that could connect to a standard TV through a
# video modulator.  The KTM-2/80 was the 80-column version (the 2/40
# could be upgraded to the 2/80 by adding 2 2114 SRAMs and a new ROM).
# I have a KTM-2/80 still in working order.  The KTM-2s had fully
# socketed parts, used 2 6507s, a 6532 as keyboard scanner, a program
# ROM and 2 ROMs as character generators. They were incredibly simple,
# and I've never had any problems with mine (witness the fact that mine
# was made in 1981 and is still working great... I've blown the video
# output transistor a couple of times, but it's a 2N2222 :-)
#
# The KTM-3 (which is what is listed in the terminfo file) was their
# attempt at putting a KTM-2 in a box (and some models came with a
# CRT). It wasn't much different from the KTM-2 hardware-wise, but the
# control and escape sequences are very different. The KTM-3 was always
# real broken, at least according to the folks I've talked to about it.
#
# The padding in the entry is probably off--these terminals were very
# slow (it takes like 100ms for the KTM-2 to clear the screen...) And
# anyone with any sanity replaced the ROMs with something that provided
# a reasonable subset of VT100 functionality, since the usual ROMs were
# obviously very primitive... oh, you could get an upgraded ROM from
# Synertek for some incredible amount of money, but what hacker with an
# EPROM burner would do that? :)
#
# Sorry I don't have any contact info; I believe they were located in
# Sunnyvale, and I'm fairly sure they are still manufacturing ICs
# (they've gone to ASICs and FPGAs), but I doubt they're in the computer
# business these days.
#

# Tested, seems to work fine with vi.

# The Teleray terminals were all discontinued in 1992-93.  RI still services
# and repairs these beasts, but no longer manufactures them.  The Teleray
# people believe that all the types listed below are very rare now (1995).
# There was a newer line of Telerays (Model 7, Model 20, Model 30, and
# Model 100) that were ANSI-compatible.
#
# Note two things called "teleray".  Reorder should move the common one
# to the front if you have either.  A dumb teleray with the cursor stuck
# on the bottom and no obvious model number is probably a 3700.

# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler <bsittler@nmt.edu>
#
# I have a UNIX PC which I use as a terminal attached to my Linux PC.
# Unfortunately, the UNIX PC terminfo entry that comes with ncurses
# is broken. All the special key sequences are broken, making it unusable
# with Emacs. The problem stems from the following:
#
# The UNIX PC has a plethora of keys (103 of them, and there's no numeric
# keypad!), loadable fonts, and strange highlighting modes ("dithered"
# half-intensity, "smeared" bold, and real strike-out, for example.) It also
# uses resizable terminal windows, but the bundled terminal program always
# uses an 80x24 window (and doesn't support seem to support a 132-column
# mode.)
#
# HISTORY: The UNIX PC was one of the first machines with a GUI, and used a
# library which was a superset of SVr3.5 curses (called tam, for "terminal
# access method".) tam includes support for real, overlapping windows,
# onscreen function key labels, and bitmap graphics. But since the primary
# user interface on the UNIX PC was a GUI program (ua, for "user
# assistant",) and remote administration was considered important for the
# machine, tam also supported VT100-compatible terminals attached to the
# serial port or used across the StarLan network. To simulate the extra keys
# not present on a VT100, users could press ESC and a two-letter sequence,
# such as u d (Undo) or U D (Shift-Undo.) These two-letter sequences,
# however, were not the same as those sent by the actual Undo key. The
# actual Undo key sends ESC 0 s unshifted, and ESC 0 S shifted, for example.
# (If you're interested in adding some of the tam calls to ncurses, btw, I
# have the full documentation and several programs which use tam. It also
# used an extended terminfo format to describe key sequences, special
# highlighting modes, etc.)
#
# KEYS: This means that ncurses would quite painful on the UNIX PC, since
# there are two sequences for every key-modifier combination (local keyboard
# sequence and remote "VT100" sequence.) But I doubt many people are trying
# to use ncurses on the UNIX PC, since ncurses doesn't properly handle the
# GUI. Unfortunately, the terminfo entry (and the termcap, too, I presume)
# seem to have been built from the manual describing the VT100 sequences.
# This means it doesn't work for a real live UNIX PC.
#
# FONTS: The UNIX PC also has a strange interpretation of "alternate
# character set". Rather than the VT100 graphics you might expect, it allows
# up to 8 custom fonts to be loaded at any given time. This means that
# programs expecting VT100 graphics will usually be disappointed. For this
# reason I have disabled the smacs/rmacs sequences, but they could easily be
# re-enabled. Here are the relevant control sequences (from the ESCAPE(7)
# manpage), should you wish to do so:
#
# SGR10 - Select font 0 - ESC [ 10 m or SO
# SGR11 - Select font 1 - ESC [ 11 m or SI
# SGR12 - Select font 2 - ESC [ 12 m
# ... (etc.)
# SGR17 - Select font 7 - ESC [ 17 m
#
# Graphics for line drawing are not reliably found at *any* character
# location because the UNIX PC has dynamically reloadable fonts. I use font
# 0 for regular text and font 1 for italics, but this is by no means
# universal. So ASCII line drawing is in order if smacs/rmacs are enabled.
#
# MISC: The cursor visible/cursor invisible sequences were swapped in the
# distributed terminfo.
#
# To ameliorate these problems (and fix a few highlighting bugs) I rewrote
# the UNIX PC terminfo entry. The modified version works great with Lynx,
# Emacs, and XEmacs running on my Linux PC and displaying on the UNIX PC
# attached by serial cable. In Emacs, even the Undo key works, and many
# applications can now use the F1-F8 keys.
#

#	from escape(7) in Unix PC 7300 Manual.
#	Somewhat similar to a vt100-am (but different enough

######## OTHER OBSOLETE TYPES
#
# These terminals are *long* dead -- these entries are retained for
# historical interest only.
#

#### Obsolete non-ANSI software emulations
#

# CTRM terminal emulator
# 1. underlining is not allowed with colors: first, is is simulated by
# black on white, second, it disables background color manipulations.
# 2. BLINKING, REVERSE and BOLD are allowed with colors,
# so we have to save their status in the static registers A, B and H
# respectively, to be able to restore them when color changes
# (because any color change turns off ALL attributes)
# 3. :md: and :mr: sequences alternate modes,
# rather than simply  entering them.  Thus we have to check the
# static register B and H to determine the status, before sending the
# escape sequence.
# 4. :me: now must set the status of all 3 register (A,B,H) to zero
# and then reset colors
# 5. implementation of the protect mode would badly penalize the performance.
# we would have to use \E&bn sequence to turn off colors (as well as all
# other attributes), and keep the status of protect mode in yet another
# static variable.  If someone really needs this mode, they would have to
# create another terminfo entry.
# 6. original color-pair is white on black.
# store the information about colors into static registers
# 7. set foreground color.  it performs the following steps.
#   1) turn off all attributes
#   2) turn on the background and video attributes that have been turned
#      on before (this information is stored in static registers X,Y,Z,A,B,H,D).
#   3) turn on foreground attributes
#   4) store information about foreground into U,V,W static registers
# 8. turn on background: similar to turn on foreground above

# From: Mark Dornfeld <romwa@ucbvax.berkeley.edu>
# This description is for the LANPAR Technologies VISION 3220
# terminal from 1984/85.  The function key definitions k0-k5 represent the
# edit keypad: FIND, INSERT HERE, REMOVE, SELECT, PREV SCREEN,
# NEXT SCREEN. The key definitions k6-k9 represent the PF1 to PF4 keys.

# Kenneth Randell <kenr@datametrics.com> writes on 31 Dec 1998:
# I had a couple of scopes (3221) like this once where I used to work, around
# the 1987 time frame if memory serves me correctly.  These scopes were made
# by an outfit called LANPAR Technologies, and were meant to me DEC VT 220
# compatible.  The 3220 was a plain text terminal like the VT-220, the 3221
# was a like the VT-240 (monochrome with Regis + Sixel graphics), and the 3222
# was like the VT-241 (color with Regis + Sixel Graphics).  These terminals
# (3221) cost about $1500 each, and one was always broken -- had to be sent
# back to the shop for repairs.
# The only real advantage these scopes had over the VT-240's were:
# 1) They were faster in the Regis display, or at least the ones I did
# 2) They had a handy debugging feature where you could split-screen the
# scope, the graphics would appear on the top, and the REGIS commands would
# appear on the bottom.  I don't remember the VT-240s being able to do that.
# I would swear that LANPAR Technologies was in MA someplace, but since I
# don't work at the same place anymore, and those terminals and manuals were
# long since junked, I cannot be any more sure than that.
#
# (v3220: removed obsolete ":kn#10:",
# I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string -- esr)

######## ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR
#
# Some non-curses applications get confused if both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# are present; the symptom is doubled characters in an update using insert.
# These applications are technically correct; in both 4.3BSD termcap and
# terminfo, you're not actually supposed to specify both ich/ich1 and rmir/smir
# unless the terminal needs both.  To my knowledge, no terminal still in this
# file requires both other than the very obsolete dm2500.
#
# For ncurses-based applications this is not a problem, as ncurses uses
# one or the other as appropriate but never mixes the two.  Therefore we
# have not corrected entries like `linux' and `xterm' that specify both.
# If you see doubled characters from these, use the linux-nic and xterm-nic
# entries that suppress ich/ich1.  And upgrade to ncurses!
#

######## VT100/ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA-48/PC-TERM TERMINAL STANDARDS
#
# ANSI X3.64 has been withdrawn and replaced by ECMA-48.  The ISO 6429 and
# ECMA-48 standards are said to be almost identical, but are not the same
# as X3.64 (though for practical purposes they are close supersets of it).
#
# You can obtain ECMA-48 for free by sending email to helpdesk@ecma.ch
# requesting the standard(s) you want (i.e. ECMA-48, "Control Functions for
# Coded Character Sets"), include your snail-mail address, and you should
# receive the document in due course.  Don't expect an email acknowledgment.
#
# Related standards include "X3.4-1977: American National Standard Code for
# Information Interchange" (the ASCII standard) and "X3.41.1974:
# Code-Extension Techniques for Use with the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of
# American National Standard for Information Interchange."  I believe (but
# am not certain) that these are effectively identical to ECMA-6 and ECMA-35
# respectively.

#### VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48
#
# ANSI Standard (X3.64) Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals
# and ECMA-48 Control Functions for Coded Character Sets.
#
# Much of the content of this comment is adapted from a table prepared by
# Richard Shuford, based on a 1984 Byte article.  Terminfo correspondences,
# discussion of some terminfo-related issues, and updates to capture ECMA-48
# have been added.  Control functions described in ECMA-48 only are tagged
# with * after their names.
#
# The table is a complete list of the defined ANSI X3.64/ECMA-48 control
# sequences.  In the main table, \E stands for an escape (\033) character,
# SPC for space.  Pn stands for a single numeric parameter to be inserted
# in decimal ASCII.  Ps stands for a list of such parameters separated by
# semicolons.  Parameter meanings for most parameterized sequences are
# described in the notes.

# Notes:
#
# Some control characters are listed in the ECMA-48 standard without
# being assigned functions relevant to terminal control there (they
# referred to other standards such as ISO 1745 or ECMA-35).  They are listed
# here anyway for completeness.
#
# (A) ECMA-48 calls this "CancelCharacter" but retains the CCH abbreviation.
#
# (B) There seems to be some confusion abroad between CHA and HPA.  Most
# `ANSI' terminals accept the CHA sequence, not the HPA. but terminfo calls
# the capability (hpa).  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Character Absolute" but
# preserved the CHA abbreviation.
#
# (C) CHT corresponds to terminfo (tab).  Usually it has the value ^I.
# Occasionally (as on, for example, certain HP terminals) this has the HTJ
# value.  ECMA-48 calls this "Cursor Forward Tabulation" but preserved the
# CHT abbreviation.
#
# (D) terminfo (nel) is usually \r\n rather than ANSI \EE.
#
# (E) ECMA-48 calls this "Active Position Report" but preserves the CPR
# abbreviation.
#
# (F) CTC parameter values:
#	0 = set char tab,
#	1 = set line tab,
#	2 = clear char tab,
#	3 = clear line tab,
#	4 = clear all char tabs on current line,
#	5 = clear all char tabs,
#	6 = clear all line tabs.
#
# (G) CUP and HVP are identical in effect.  Some ANSI.SYS versions accept
# HVP, but always allow CUP as an alternate.  ECMA-48 calls HVP "Character
# Position Absolute" but retains the HVP abbreviation.
#
# (H) ECMA calls this "Cursor Line Tabulation" but preserves the CVT
# abbreviation.
#
# (I) DSR parameter values:
#	0 = ready,
#	1 = busy,
#	2 = busy, will send DSR later,
#	3 = malfunction,
#	4 = malfunction, will send DSR later,
#	5 = request DSR,
#	6 = request CPR response.
#
# (J) ECMA calls ED "Erase In Page". EA/ED/EL parameters:
#	0 = clear to end,
#	1 = clear from beginning,
#	2 = clear.
#
# (K) ECMA calls this "End of Guarded Area" but preserves the EPA abbreviation.
#
# (L) The GSM parameters are vertical and horizontal parameters to scale by.
#
# (M) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept HPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUF for this function and ignore HPR.  ECMA-48 calls this "Character
# Position Relative" but retains the HPR abbreviation.
#
# (N) ECMA-48 calls this "Character Tabulation" but retains the HT
# abbreviation.

#	61-65 = variable highlights for ideograms.
#
# (P) SI is also called LSO, Locking Shift Zero.
#
# (Q) SI is also called LS1, Locking Shift One.
#
# (R) Some ANSI.SYS versions accept VPR, but more commonly `ANSI' terminals
# use CUD for this function and ignore VPR.  ECMA calls it `Line Position
# Absolute' but retains the VPA abbreviation.
#
# (S) MC parameters:
#	0 = start xfer to primary aux device,
#	1 = start xfer from primary aux device,
#	2 = start xfer to secondary aux device,
#	3 = start xfer from secondary aux device,
#	4 = stop relay to primary aux device,
#	5 = start relay to primary aux device,
#	6 = stop relay to secondary aux device,
#	7 = start relay to secondary aux device.
#
# (T) ECMA-48 calls this "Partial Line Forward" but retains the PLD
# abbreviation.
#
# (U) ECMA-48 calls this "Partial Line Backward" but retains the PLU
# abbreviation.
#
# (V) ECMA-48 calls this "Reverse Line Feed" but retains the RI abbreviation.
#
# (W) RM/SM modes are as follows:
#	1 = Guarded Area Transfer Mode (GATM),

#
# The EBM and LF/NL modes have actually been removed from ECMA-48's 5th edition
# but are listed here for reference.
#
# (X) Select Alternate Presentation Variants is used only for non-Latin
# alphabets.
#
# (Y) "Select Editing Extent" (SEE) was ANSI "Select Edit Extent Mode" (SEM).
#
# (Z) ECMA-48 calls this "Start of Guarded Area" but retains the SPA

#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Abbreviations:
#
# Intro  an Introducer of some kind of defined sequence; the normal 7-bit
#        X3.64 Control Sequence Introducer is the two characters "Escape ["
#
# Delim  a Delimiter
#
# x/y    identifies a character by position in the ASCII table (column/row)
#
# eF     editor function (see explanation)
#
# FE     format effector (see explanation)
#
# F      is a Final character in
#             an Escape sequence (F from 3/0 to 7/14 in the ASCII table)
#             a control sequence (F from 4/0 to 7/14)
#
# Gs     is a graphic character appearing in strings (Gs ranges from
#        2/0 to 7/14) in the ASCII table
#
# Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
#        of controls in an 8-bit character set
#
# C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters
#
# C1     roughly, the set of control chars available only in 8-bit systems.
#        This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
#        article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.
#
# Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
#        equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
#        (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)
#
# Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
#        standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
#        and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
#        designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)
#
# I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the
#        ASCII table
#
# P      is a parameter character from 3/0 to 3/15 (inclusive) in the ASCII
#        table
#
# Pn     is a numeric parameter in a control sequence, a string of zero or
#        more characters ranging from 3/0 to 3/9 in the ASCII table
#
# Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
#        with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
#        3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
#        3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11
#
# *      Not relevant to terminal control, listed for completeness only.
#
# Format Effectors versus Editor Functions
#
# A format effector specifies how following output is to be displayed.
# An editor function allows you to modify the display.  Informally
# format effectors may be destructive; format effectors should not be.
#
# For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the
# cursor or equivalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
# create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
# overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
# format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
# nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
# left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
# be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
# overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
# mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
# its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
# return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.
#
# NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION
#
# Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:
#
#      CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
#      LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC
#
# plus several private DEC commands.
#
# Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:
#
#      Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
#      Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
#      Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
#      Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
#      Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
#      Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J
#
# Some brain-damaged terminal/emulators respond to Esc [ J as if it were
# Esc [ 2 J, but this is wrong; the default is 0.
#
# The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control
#
#      Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)
#
# by transmitting the sequence
#
#      Esc [ ? l ; Ps c
#
# where Ps is a character that describes installed options.
#
# The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
# Report) control
#
#      Esc [ 6 n
#
# The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence
#
#      Esc [ Pl ; Pc R
#
# where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).
#
# The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.

#### ANSI.SYS
#
# Here is a description of the color and attribute controls supported in the
# the ANSI.SYS driver under MS-DOS.  Most console drivers and ANSI
# terminal emulators for Intel boxes obey these.  They are a proper subset
# of the ECMA-48 escapes.
#
# 0	all attributes off
# 1	foreground bright
# 4	underscore on
# 5	blink on/background bright (not reliable with brown)
# 7	reverse-video
# 8	set blank (non-display)
# 10	set primary font
# 11	set first alternate font (on PCs, display ROM characters 1-31)
# 12	set second alternate font (on PCs, display IBM high-half chars)
#
#			Color attribute sets
# 3n	set foreground color       / 0=black, 1=red,     2=green, 3=brown,
# 4n	set background color       \ 4=blue,  5=magenta, 6=cyan,  7=white
# Bright black becomes gray.  Bright brown becomes yellow,
# These coincide with the prescriptions of the ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.
#
# * If the 5 attribute is on and you set a background color (40-47) it is
#   supposed to enable bright background.
#
# * Many VGA cards (such as the Paradise and compatibles) do the wrong thing
#   when you try to set a "bright brown" (yellow) background with attribute
#   5 (you get a blinking yellow foreground instead).  A few displays
#   (including the System V console) support an attribute 6 that undoes this
#   braindamage (this is required by iBCS2).
#
# * Some older versions of ANSI.SYS have a bug that causes thems to require
#   ESC [ Pn k as EL rather than the ANSI ESC [ Pn K.  (This is not ECMA-48
#   compatible.)

#### Intel Binary Compatibility Standard
#
# For comparison, here are the capabilities implied by the Intel Binary
# Compatibility Standard for UNIX systems (Intel order number 468366-001).
# These recommendations are optional.  IBCS2 allows the leading escape to
# be either the 7-bit \E[ or 8-bit \0233 introducer, in accordance with
# the ANSI X.364/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 standard.  Here are the iBCS2 capabilities
# (as described in figure 9-3 of the standard).  Those expressed in the ibcs2
# terminfo entry are followed with the corresponding capability in parens:
#
#	CSI <n>k		disable (n=0) or enable (n=1) keyclick
#	CSI 2h			lock keyboard
#	CSI 2i			send screen as input
#	CSI 2l			unlock keyboard
#	CSI 6m			enable background color intensity
#	CSI <0-2>c		reserved
#	CSI <0-59>m		select graphic rendition
#	CSI <n>;<m>H	(cup)	cursor to line n and column m
#	CSI <n>;<m>f		cursor to line n and column m
#	CSI <n>@	(ich)	insert characters
#	CSI <n>A	(cuu)	cursor up n lines
#	CSI <n>B	(cud)	cursor down n lines
#	CSI <n>C	(cuu)	cursor right n characters
#	CSI <n>D	(cud)	cursor left n characters
#	CSI <n>E		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>F		cursor up n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>G	(hpa)	position cursor at column n-1
#	CSI <n>J	(ed)	erase in display
#	CSI <n>K	(el)	erase in line
#	CSI <n>L	(il)	insert line(s)
#	CSI <n>P	(dch)	delete characters
#	CSI <n>S	(indn)	scroll up n lines
#	CSI <n>T	(rin)	scroll down n lines
#	CSI <n>X	(ech)	erase characters
#	CSI <n>Z	(cbt)	back up n tab stops
#	CSI <n>`		cursor to column n on line
#	CSI <n>a	(cuu)	cursor right n characters
#	CSI <n>d	(vpa)	cursor to line n
#	CSI <n>e		cursor down n lines and in first column
#	CSI <n>g	(cbt)	clear all tabs
#	CSI <n>z		make virtual terminal n active
#	CSI ?7h		(smam)	turn automargin on
#	CSI ?7l		(rmam)	turn automargin off
#	CSI s			save cursor position
#	CSI u			restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI =<c>A		set overscan color
#	CSI =<c>F		set normal foreground color
#	CSI =<c>G		set normal background color
#	CSI =<c>H		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>I		set reverse foreground color
#	CSI =<c>J		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<c>K		set graphic foreground color
#	CSI =<n>g	(dispc) display n from alternate graphics character set
#	CSI =<p>;<d>B		set bell parameters
#	CSI =<s>;<e>C		set cursor parameters
#	CSI =<x>D		enable/disable intensity of background color
#	CSI =<x>E		set/clear blink vs. bold background
#	CSI 7		(sc)	(sc) save cursor position
#	CSI 8		(rc)	(rc) restore cursor position to saved value
#	CSI H		(hts)	(hts) set tab stop
#	CSI Q<n><string>	define function key string
#				(string must begin and end with delimiter char)
#	CSI c		(clear) clear screen
#
# The lack of any specification for attributes in SGR (among other things)
# makes this a wretchedly weak standard. The table above is literally
# everything iBSC2 has to say about terminal escape sequences; there is
# no further discussion of their meaning or how to set the parameters
# in these sequences at all.

######## NONSTANDARD CAPABILITY TRANSLATIONS USED IN THIS FILE
#
# The historical termcap file entries were written primarily in 4.4BSD termcap.
# The 4.4BSD termcap set was substantially larger than the original 4.1BSD set,
# with the extension names chosen for compatibility with the termcap names
# assigned in System V terminfo.  There are some variant extension sets out
# there.  We try to describe them here.
#
#### XENIX extensions:
#
# The XENIX extensions include a set of function-key capabilities as follows:
#
#       code	XENIX variable name	terminfo name	name clashes?
#	----	-------------------	-------------	-----------------------
#	CL	key_char_left
#	CR	key_char_right
#	CW	key_change_window			create_window
#	EN	key_end			kend
#	HM	key_home		khome
#	HP	??
#	LD	key_delete_line		kdl1

#	RT	key_return		kent
#	UP	key_up_arrow		kcuu1		parm_up_cursor
#	WL	key_word_left
#	WR	key_word_right
#
# The XENIX extensions also include the following character-set and highlight
# capabilities:
#
#	XENIX	terminfo	function
#	-----	--------	------------------------------
#	GS	smacs		start alternate character set
#	GE	rmacs		end alternate character set
#	GG			:as:/:ae: glitch (analogous to :sg:/:ug:)
#	bo	blink		begin blink (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	be			end blink (not used in /etc/termcap)

#	it	dim		begin dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ie			end dim (not used in /etc/termcap)
#	ig			dim glitch  (not used in /etc/termcap)
#
# Finally, XENIX also used the following forms-drawing capabilities:
#
#	single	double  type             ASCII approximation
#	------	------	-------------    -------------------
#	GV	Gv	vertical line             |
#	GH	Gv	horizontal line       -   _
#	G1	G5	top right corner       _   |
#	G2	G6	top left corner       |
#	G3	G7	bottom left corner         |_
#	G4	G8	bottom right corner   _|
#	GD	Gd	down-tick character        T
#	GL	Gl	left-tick character   -|
#	GR	Gr	right-tick character       |-
#	GC	Gc	middle intersection   -|-
#	GU	Gu	up-tick character          _|_
#
# These were invented to take advantage of the IBM PC ROM character set.  One
# can compose an acsc string from the single-width characters as follows
#	"j{G4}k{G1}l{G2}m{G3}q{GH}x{GV}t{GR}u{GL}v{GU}w{GD}n{GC}"
# When translating a termcap file, ncurses tic will do this automatically.
# The double forms characters don't fit the SVr4 terminfo model.
#
#### AT&T Extensions:
#
# The old AT&T 5410, 5420, 5425, pc6300plus, 610, and s4 entries used a set of
# nonstandard capabilities.  Its signature is the KM capability, used to name
# some sort of keymap file.  EE, BO, CI, CV, XS, DS, FL and FE are in this
# set.  Comments in the original, and a little cross-checking with other AT&T
# documentation, seem to establish that BO=:mr: (start reverse video), DS=:mh:
# (start dim), XS=:mk: (secure/invisible mode), EE=:me: (end highlights),
# FL=:LO: (enable soft labels), FE=:LF: (disable soft labels), CI=:vi: (make
# cursor invisible), and CV=:ve: (make cursor normal).
#
#### HP Extensions
#
# The HP library (as of mid-1995, their term.h file version 70.1) appears to
# have the System V capabilities up to SVr1 level.  After that, it supports
# two nonstandard caps meml and memu corresponding to the old termcap :ml:,
# :mu: capabilities.  After that, it supports caps plab_norm, label_on,
# label_off, and key_f11..key_f63 capabilities like SVr4's.  This makes the
# HP binary format incompatible with SVr4's.
#
#### IBM Extensions
#
# There is a set of nonstandard terminfos used by IBM's AIX operating system.
# The AIX terminfo library diverged from SVr1 terminfo, and replaces all
# capabilities following prtr_non with the following special capabilities:
# box[12], batt[12], colb[0123456789], colf[0123456789], f[01234567], kbtab,
# kdo, kcmd, kcpn, kend, khlp, knl, knpn, kppn, kppn, kquit, ksel, kscl, kscr,
# ktab, kmpf[123456789], apstr, ksf1..ksf10, kf11...kf63, kact, topl, btml,
# rvert, lvert.   Some of these are identical to XPG4/SVr4 equivalents:
# kcmd, kend, khlp, and kf11...kf63.  Two others (kbtab and ksel) can be
# renamed (to kcbt and kslt).  The places in the box[12] capabilities
# correspond to acsc chars, here is the mapping:
#
#	box1[0]  = ACS_ULCORNER
#	box1[1]  = ACS_HLINE
#	box1[2]  = ACS_URCORNER
#	box1[3]  = ACS_VLINE
#	box1[4]  = ACS_LRCORNER
#	box1[5]  = ACS_LLCORNER
#	box1[6]  = ACS_TTEE
#	box1[7]  = ACS_RTEE
#	box1[8]  = ACS_BTEE
#	box1[9]  = ACS_LTEE
#	box1[10] = ACS_PLUS
#
# The box2 characters are the double-line versions of these forms graphics.
# The AIX binary terminfo format is incompatible with SVr4's.
#
#### Iris console extensions:
#
# HS is half-intensity start; HE is half-intensity end
# CT is color terminal type (for Curses & rogue)
# CP is color change escape sequence
# CZ are color names (for Curses & rogue)
#
# The ncurses tic utility recognizes HS as an alias for mh <dim>.
#
#### TC Extensions:
#
# There is a set of extended termcaps associated with something
# called the "Terminal Control" or TC package created by MainStream Systems,
# Winfield Kansas.  This one also uses GS/GE for as/ae, and also uses
# CF for civis and CO for cvvis.  Finally, they define a boolean :ct:
# that flags color terminals.
#
######## NCURSES USER-DEFINABLE CAPABILITIES
#
# Extensions added after ncurses 5.0 generally use the "-x" option of tic and
# infocmp to manipulate user-definable capabilities.  Those that are intended
# for use in either terminfo or termcap use 2-character names.  Extended
# function keys do not use 2-character names, and are available only with
# terminfo.
#
# Beginning in 2010, NetBSD curses has also provided a "-x" option for
# tic/infocmp, and uses this database (with a few changes).  There are a few
# differences, noted in
#	http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-netbsd.html
#
# ncurses makes explicit checks for a few user-definable capabilities:  AX,
# RGB, U8, XM, which are documented in the user_caps(5) manual page.
#
#### SCREEN Extensions:
#
# The screen program uses the termcap interface.  It recognizes a few useful
# nonstandard capabilities.  Those are used in this file.
#
#       AX   (bool)  Does  understand  ANSI  set  default fg/bg color (\E[39m /
#                    \E[49m).
#       G0   (bool)  Terminal can deal with ISO 2022  font  selection sequences.
#       E0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' back to standard charset.
#       S0   (str)   Switch charset 'G0' to the specified charset.
#       XT   (bool)  Terminal understands special xterm sequences  (OSC,  mouse
#                    tracking).
#
# AX is relatively straightforward; it is interpreted by ncurses to say that
# SGR 39/49 reset the terminal's foreground and background colors to their
# "default".
#
# XT is harder, since screen's manpage does not give more details.  For that,
# we must read screen's source-code.  When XT is set, screen assumes
#
# a) OSC 1 sets the title string, e.g., for the icon.  Recent versions of
#    screen may also set the terminal's name, which is (for xterm) distinct
#    from the icon name.
# b) OSC 20 sets the background pixmap.  This is an rxvt feature.
# c) OSC 39 and OSC 49 set the default foreground/background colors.  Again
#    this is an rxvt feature.
# d) certain mode settings enable the mouse: 9, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003.
#    These are from xterm, although xterm accepts mouse codes that may not be
#    recognized by screen, e.g., 1005, 1006.
# e) colors beyond 0..7 are implemented by xterm's aixterm-like 16-color
#    sequence.  However, because screen uses only termcap, the values returned
#    by Af/Ab are not usable because they rely on expressions that termcap
#    does not support.  Therefore, screen uses a hardcoded string to work
#    around the limitation.
# f) all entries named "*xterm*" or "*rxvt*" have the bce flag set.
#
# The other ISO-2022 features are rarely used, but provided here to make
# screen's termcap features available.
#
#### XTERM Extensions:
#
# Most of the xterm extensions are for function-keys.  Since xterm patch #94 (in
# 1999), xterm has supported shift/control/alt/meta modifiers which produce
# additional function-key strings.  Some other developers copied the feature,
# though they did not follow xterm's lead in xterm patch #167 (in 2002), to make
# these key definitions less ambiguous.
#
# A few terminals provide similar functionality (sending distinct keys when
# a modifier is used), including rxvt.
#
# These are the extended keys defined in this file:
#
# kDC3 kDC4 kDC5 kDC6 kDC7 kDN kDN3 kDN4 kDN5 kDN6 kDN7 kEND3 kEND4 kEND5 kEND6
# kEND7 kHOM3 kHOM4 kHOM5 kHOM6 kHOM7 kIC3 kIC4 kIC5 kIC6 kIC7 kLFT3 kLFT4
# kLFT5 kLFT6 kLFT7 kNXT3 kNXT4 kNXT5 kNXT6 kNXT7 kPRV3 kPRV4 kPRV5 kPRV6 kPRV7
# kRIT3 kRIT4 kRIT5 kRIT6 kRIT7 kUP kUP3 kUP4 kUP5 kUP6 kUP7 ka2 kb1 kb3 kc2
#
# Here are the other xterm-related extensions which are used in this file:
#
# Cr is a string capability which resets the cursor color
# Cs is a string capability which sets the cursor color to a given value.
#    The single string parameter is the color name/number, according to the
#    implementation.
# Ms modifies the selection/clipboard.  Its parameters are
#	p1 = the storage unit (clipboard, selection or cut buffer)
#	p2 = the base64-encoded clipboard content.
# Se resets the cursor style to the terminal power-on default.
# Ss is a string capability with one numeric parameter.  It is used to set the
#    cursor style as described by the DECSCUSR function to a block or
#    underline.
# TS is a string capability which acts like "tsl", but uses no parameter and
#    goes to the first column of the "status line".
# XM is a string capability which overrides ncurses's built-in string which
#    enables/disables xterm mouse mode.
# xm shows the format of the mouse responses.  Parameters are (from zero):
#	p1 = y-ordinate
#	p2 = x-ordinate
#	p3 = button
#	p4 = state, e.g., pressed or released
#	p6 = y-ordinate starting region
#	p7 = x-ordinate starting region
#	p8 = y-ordinate ending region
#	p9 = x-ordinate ending region
# Other extensions, used in xm:
#	%u = UTF-8
#
#### Miscellaneous extensions:
#
# gsbom/grbom are used to enable/disable real bold (not intensity bright) mode.
#    This was implemented for the Hurd.
# rmxx/smxx describes the ECMA-48 strikeout/crossed-out attributes, as an
#    experimental feature of tmux.
# E3 clears the terminal's scrollback buffer.  This was implemented in the
#    Linux 3.0 kernel as a security feature.  It matches a feature which was
#    added in xterm patch #107.
# U8 is a numeric capability which denotes a terminal emulator which does not
#    support VT100 SI/SO when processing UTF-8 encoding.  Set this to a nonzero
#    value to enable it.
#
######## CHANGE HISTORY
#
# The last /etc/termcap version maintained by John Kunze was 8.3, dated 8/5/94.
# Releases 9 and 10 (up until the release of ncurses 4.2 in 1998) were
# maintained by Eric S. Raymond as part of the ncurses project.
#
# This file contains all the capability information present in John Kunze's
# last version of the termcap master file, except as noted in the change
# comments at end of file.  Some information about very ancient obsolete
# capabilities has been moved to comments.  Some all-numeric names of older
# terminals have been retired.
#
# I changed :MT: to :km: (the 4.4BSD name) everywhere.  I commented out some
# capabilities (EP, dF, dT, dV, kn, ma, ml, mu, xr, xx) that are no longer
# used by BSD curses.
#
# The 9.1.0 version of this file was translated from my lightly-edited copy of
# 8.3, then mechanically checked against 8.3 using Emacs Lisp code written for
# the purpose.  Unless the ncurses tic implementation and the Lisp code were
# making perfectly synchronized mistakes which I then failed to catch by
# eyeball, the translation was correct and perfectly information-preserving.
#
# Major version number bumps correspond to major version changes in ncurses.
#

#
# 9.7.0 (Tue May  9 18:03:12 EDT 1995):
#	* Added vt320-k3, rsvidtx from the Emacs termcap.dat file.  I think
#	  that captures everything unique from it.
#	* Added reorder script generator.
#	* Freeze for ncurses 1.9.2 release.
# 9.7.1 (Thu Jun 29 09:35:22 EDT 1995):
#	* Added Sean Farley's kspd, flash, rs1 capabilities for linux.
#	* Added Olaf Siebert's corrections for adm12.

#	* Added vt102-nsgr to cope with stupid IBM PC `VT100' emulators.
#	* Some commented-out caps in long entries come back in, my code
#	  for computing string-table lengths had a bug in it.
#	* pcansi series modified to fit comm-program reality better.
# 9.8.2 (Sat Sep  9 23:35:00 EDT 1995):
#	* BSD/OS actually ships the ibmpc3 bold entry as its console.
#	* Correct some bad aliases in the pcansi series
#	* Added entry for QNX console.
#	* Clean up duplicate long names for use with 4.4 library.
#	* Change vt100 standout to be normal reverse vide, not bright reverse;
#	  this makes the Emacs status line look better.

# 9.9.2 (Sat Sep 23 21:29:21 EDT 1995):
#	* Added 7 newly discovered, undocumented acsc characters to linux
#	  entry (the pryz{|} characters).
#	* ncurses no longer steals A_PROTECT.  Simplify linux sgr accordingly.
#	* Correct two typos in the xterm entries introduced in 9.9.1.
#	* I finally figured out how to translate ko capabilities.  Done.
#	* Added tvi921 entries from Tim Theisen.
#	* Cleanup: dgd211 -> dg211, adm42-nl -> adm42-nsl.
#	* Removed mystery tec entry, it was neither interesting nor useful.
#	* shortened altos3, qvt203, tvi910+, tvi92D, tvi921-g, tvi955, vi200-f,
#	  vi300-ss, att505-24, contel301, dm3045, f200vi, pe7000c, vc303a,
#	  trs200, wind26, wind40, wind50, cdc456tst, dku7003, f110, dg211,
#	  by making them relative to use capabilities
#	* Added cuf1=^L to tvi925 from deleted variant tvi925a.

#	* added it#8 to entries that used to have :pt: -- tvi912, vi200,
#	  ampex80,
#	* Translate all home=\E[;H capabilities to home=\E[H, they're
#	  equivalent.
#	* Translate \E[0m -> \E[m in [rs]mso, [rs]mul, and init strings of
#	  vt100 and ANSI-like terminals.
# 9.9.3 (Tue Sep 26 20:11:15 EDT 1995):
#	* Added it#8 and ht=\t to *all* entries with :pt:; the ncurses tic
#	  does this now, too.
#	* fviewpoint is gone, it duplicated screwpoint.
#	* Added hp2627, graphos, graphos-30, hpex, ibmega, ibm8514, ibm8514-c,
#	  ibmvga, ibmvga-c, minix, mm340, mt4520-rv, screen2, screen3,
#	  versaterm, vi500, vsc, vt131, vt340, vt400 entries from UW.
#	  The UW vi50 replaces the old one, which becomes vi50adm,
#	* No more embedded commas in name fields.
#
# 9.10.0 (Wed Oct  4 15:39:37 EDT 1995):
#	* XENIX forms characters in fos, trs16, scoansi become acsc strings,
#	* Introduced klone+* entries for describing Intel-console behavior.
#	* Linux kbs is default-mapped to delete for some brain-dead reason.
#	* -nsl -> -ns.  The -pp syntax is obsolete.
#	* Eliminate [A-Z]* primaries in accordance with SVr4 terminfo docs.

#	* Added some longname fields in order to avoid warning messages from
#	  older tic implementations.
#	* According to ctlseqs.ms, xterm has a full vt100 graphics set.  Use
#	  it! (This gives us pi, greater than, less than, and a few more.)
#	* Freeze for ncurses-1.9.6 release.
# 9.10.1 (Sat Oct 21 22:18:09 EDT 1995):
#	* Add xon to a number of console entries, they're memory-mapped and
#	  don't need padding.
#	* Correct the use dependencies in the ansi series.
#	* Hand-translate more XENIX capabilities.
#	* Added hpterm entry for HP's X terminal emulator.
#	* Added aixterm entries.
