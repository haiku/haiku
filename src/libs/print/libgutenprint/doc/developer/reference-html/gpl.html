>&#13;      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
      Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
      and change free software - to make sure the software is free for
      all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of
      the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
      whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
      Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
      License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
      that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
      (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
      source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
      the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
      you know you can do these things.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
      for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
      modify it.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
      that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
      get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
      know their rights.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      We protect your rights with two steps:

      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    copyright the software, and
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
	    copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
	  </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
      patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
      free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
      making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it
      clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use
      or not licensed at all.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.
