About dot-zero releases

These are the release notes for the DocBook XSL Stylesheets distribution. This
document lists enhancements and changes to the public APIs (user-configurable
parameters) and generally excludes descriptions of bug fixes, which are
instead documented in a separate NEWS file.

Release: 1.70.1

This is a stable release of the 1.70 stylesheets. It includes only a few small
changes from 1.70.0.

The following is a list of changes that have been made since the 1.70.0
release.

FO

The following changes have been made to the fo code since the 1.70.0 release.

  * Added three new attribute sets (revhistory.title.properties,
    revhistory.table.properties and revhistory.table.cell.properties) for
    controlling appearance of revhistory in FO output.

    Modified: fo/block.xsl,1.34; fo/param.ent,1.101; fo/param.xweb,1.114;
    fo/titlepage.xsl,1.41; params/revhistory.table.cell.properties.xml,1.1;
    params/revhistory.table.properties.xml,1.1;
    params/revhistory.title.properties.xml,1.1 - Jirka Kosek

  * Support DBv5 revisions with full author name (not only authorinitials)

    Modified: fo/block.xsl,1.33; fo/titlepage.xsl,1.40 - Jirka Kosek

HTML

The following changes have been made to the html code since the 1.70.0
release.

  * Support DBv5 revisions with full author name (not only authorinitials)

    Modified: html/block.xsl,1.23; html/titlepage.xsl,1.34 - Jirka Kosek

HTMLHelp

The following changes have been made to the htmlhelp code since the 1.70.0
release.

  * htmlhelp.generate.index is now param, not variable. This means that you
    can override its setting from outside. This is useful when you generate
    indexterms on the fly (see
    http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/14/dbndx.html?page=3).

    Modified: htmlhelp/htmlhelp-common.xsl,1.38 - Jirka Kosek

  * Support chunk.tocs.and.lots in HTML Help

    Modified: htmlhelp/htmlhelp-common.xsl,1.37 - Jirka Kosek

Params

The following changes have been made to the params code since the 1.70.0
release.

  * Added three new attribute sets (revhistory.title.properties,
    revhistory.table.properties and revhistory.table.cell.properties) for
    controlling appearance of revhistory in FO output.

    Modified: fo/block.xsl,1.34; fo/param.ent,1.101; fo/param.xweb,1.114;
    fo/titlepage.xsl,1.41; params/revhistory.table.cell.properties.xml,1.1;
    params/revhistory.table.properties.xml,1.1;
    params/revhistory.title.properties.xml,1.1 - Jirka Kosek

Release: 1.70.0

As with all DocBook Project dot-zero releases, this is an experimental
release. It will be followed shortly by a stable release.

This release adds a number of new features, including:

  * support for selecting alternative index-collation methods (in particular,
    support for using a collation library developed by Eliot Kimber)

  * improved handling of DocBook 5 document instances (through a
    namespace-stripping mechanism)

  * full support for CALS and HTML tables in manpages output

  * a mechanism for preserving relative URIs in documents that make use of
    XInclude

  * support for the "new" .90 version of FOP

  * enhanced capabilities for controlling formatting of lists in HTML and FO
    output

  * autogeneration of AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT sections in manpages output

  * support for generating crop marks in FO/PDF output

  * support for qandaset as a root element in FO output

  * support for floatstyle and orient on all table types

  * support for floatstyle in figure, and example

  * pgwide.properties attribute-set supports extending figure, example and
    table into the left indent area instead of spanning multiple columns.

The following is a detailed list of enhancements and API changes that have
been made since the 1.69.1 release.

Common

The following changes have been made to the common code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * Add the xsl:key for the kimber indexing method.

    Modified: common/autoidx-ng.xsl,1.2 - Robert Stayton

  * Add support for qandaset.

    Modified: common/labels.xsl,1.37; common/subtitles.xsl,1.7;
    common/titles.xsl,1.35 - Robert Stayton

  * Support dbhtml/dbfo start PI for orderedlist numbering in both HTML and FO

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.61; html/lists.xsl,1.50 - Norman Walsh

  * Added CVS header.

    Modified: common/stripns.xsl,1.12 - Robert Stayton

  * Changed content model of text element to ANY rather than #PCDATA because
    they could contain markup.

    Modified: common/targetdatabase.dtd,1.7 - Robert Stayton

  * Added refentry.meta.get.quietly param.

    If zero (the default), notes and warnings about "missing" markup are
    generated during gathering of refentry metadata. If non-zero, the metadata
    is gathered "quietly" -- that is, the notes and warnings are suppressed.

    NOTE: If you are processing a large amount of refentry content, you may be
    able to speed up processing significantly by setting a non-zero value for
    refentry.meta.get.quietly.

    Modified: common/refentry.xsl,1.17; manpages/param.ent,1.15;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.17; params/refentry.meta.get.quietly.xml,1.1 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * After namespace stripping, the source document is the temporary tree
    created by the stripping process and it has the wrong base URI for
    relative references. Earlier versions of this code used to try to fix that
    by patching the elements with relative @fileref attributes. That was
    inadequate because it calculated an absolute base URI without considering
    that there might be xml:base attributes already in effect. It seems
    obvious now that the right thing to do is simply to put the xml:base on
    the root of the document. And that seems to work.

    Modified: common/stripns.xsl,1.7 - Norman Walsh

  * Added support for "software" and "sectdesc" class values on refmiscinfo;
    "software" is treated identically to "source", and "setdesc" is treated
    identically to "manual".

    Modified: common/refentry.xsl,1.10;
    params/man.th.extra2.max.length.xml,1.3;
    params/refentry.source.name.profile.xml,1.4 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added support for DocBook 5 namespace-stripping in manpages stylesheet.
    Closes request #1210692.

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.56; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.57 - Michael(tm)
    Smith

  * Added <xsl:template match="/"> to make stripns.xsl usable as a standalone
    stylesheet for stripping out DocBook 5/NG to DocBook 4. Note that DocBook
    XSLT drivers that include this stylesheet all override the match="/"
    template.

    Modified: common/stripns.xsl,1.4 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Number figures, examples, and tables from book if there is no prefix (i.e.
    if chapter.autolabel is set to 0). This avoids having the list of figures
    where the figures mysteriously restart their numeration periodically when
    chapter.autolabel is set to 0.

    Modified: common/labels.xsl,1.36 - David Cramer

  * Add task template in title.markup mode.

    Modified: common/titles.xsl,1.34 - Robert Stayton

  * Add children (with ids) of formal objects to target data.

    Modified: common/targets.xsl,1.10 - Robert Stayton

  * Added support for case when personname doesn't contain specific name
    markup (as allowed in DocBook 5.0)

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.54 - Jirka Kosek

Extensions

The following changes have been made to the extensions code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * Support Xalan 2.7

    Modified: extensions/xalan27/.cvsignore,1.1;
    extensions/xalan27/build.xml,1.1;
    extensions/xalan27/nbproject/.cvsignore,1.1;

    extensions/xalan27/src/com/nwalsh/xalan/Text.java,1.1;
    extensions/xalan27/src/com/nwalsh/xalan/Verbatim.java,1.1 - Norman Walsh

  * Handle the case where the imageFn is actually a URI. This still needs
    work.

    Modified: extensions/saxon643/com/nwalsh/saxon/ImageIntrinsics.java,1.4 -
    Norman Walsh

FO

The following changes have been made to the fo code since the 1.69.1 release.

  * Adapted to the new indexing code. Now works just like a wrapper that calls
    kosek indexing method, originally implemented here.

    Modified: fo/autoidx-ng.xsl,1.5 - Jirka Kosek

  * Added parameters for header/footer table minimum height.

    Modified: fo/pagesetup.xsl,1.60; fo/param.ent,1.100; fo/param.xweb,1.113 -
    Robert Stayton

  * Add the index.method parameter.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.99; fo/param.xweb,1.112 - Robert Stayton

  * Integrate support for three indexing methods: - the original English-only
    method. - Jirka Kosek's method using EXSLT extensions. - Eliot Kimber's
    method using Saxon extensions. Use the 'index.method' parameter to select.

    Modified: fo/autoidx.xsl,1.38 - Robert Stayton

  * Add support for TOC for qandaset in fo output.

    Modified: fo/autotoc.xsl,1.30; fo/qandaset.xsl,1.20 - Robert Stayton

  * Added parameter ulink.hyphenate.chars. Added parameter insert.link
    .page.number.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.98; fo/param.xweb,1.111 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented feature request #942524 to add insert.link.page.number to
    allow link element cross references to have a page number.

    Modified: fo/xref.xsl,1.67 - Robert Stayton

  * Add support for ulink.hyphenate.chars so more characters can be break
    points in urls.

    Modified: fo/xref.xsl,1.66 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented patch #1075144 to make the url text in a ulink in FO output an
    active link as well.

    Modified: fo/xref.xsl,1.65 - Robert Stayton

  * table footnotes now have their own table.footnote.properties attribute
    set.

    Modified: fo/footnote.xsl,1.23 - Robert Stayton

  * Add qandaset to root.elements.

    Modified: fo/docbook.xsl,1.41 - Robert Stayton

  * Added mode="page.sequence" to make it easier to put content into a page
    sequence. First used for qandaset.

    Modified: fo/component.xsl,1.37 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented feature request #1434408 to support formatting of biblioentry.

    Modified: fo/biblio.xsl,1.35 - Robert Stayton

  * Added biblioentry.properties.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.97; fo/param.xweb,1.110 - Robert Stayton

  * Support PTC/Arbortext bookmarks

    Modified: fo/docbook.xsl,1.40; fo/ptc.xsl,1.1 - Norman Walsh

  * Added table.footnote.properties to permit table footnotes to format
    differently from regular footnotes.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.96; fo/param.xweb,1.109 - Robert Stayton

  * Refactored table templates to unify their processing and support all
    options in all types. Now table and informaltable, in both Cals and Html
    markup, use the same templates where possible, and all support pgwide,
    rotation, and floats. There is also a placeholder table.container template
    to support wrapping a table in a layout table, so the XEP table title
    "continued" extension can be more easily implemented.

    Modified: fo/formal.xsl,1.52; fo/htmltbl.xsl,1.9; fo/table.xsl,1.48 -
    Robert Stayton

  * Added new attribute set toc.line.properties for controlling appearance of
    lines in ToC/LoT

    Modified: fo/autotoc.xsl,1.29; fo/param.ent,1.95; fo/param.xweb,1.108 -
    Jirka Kosek

  * Added support for float to example and equation. Added support for pgwide
    to figure, example, and equation (the latter two via a dbfo pgwide="1"
    processing instruction).

    Modified: fo/formal.xsl,1.51 - Robert Stayton

  * Add pgwide.properties attribute-set.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.94; fo/param.xweb,1.107 - Robert Stayton

  * Added refclass.suppress param.

    If the value of refclass.suppress is non-zero, then display refclass
    contents is suppressed in output. Affects HTML and FO output only.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.93; fo/param.xweb,1.106; html/param.ent,1.90;
    html/param.xweb,1.99; params/refclass.suppress.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Improved support for task subelements

    Modified: fo/task.xsl,1.3; html/task.xsl,1.3 - Jirka Kosek

  * Adjusted spacing around K&R-formatted Funcdef and Paramdef output such
    that it can more easily be discerned where one ends and the other begins.
    Closes #1213264.

    Modified: fo/synop.xsl,1.18 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Made handling of paramdef/parameter in FO output consistent with that in
    HTML and manpages output. Closes #1213259.

    Modified: fo/synop.xsl,1.17 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Made handling of Refnamediv consistent with formatting in HTML and
    manpages output; specifically, changed so that Refname (comma-separated
    list of multiple instances found) is used (instead of Refentrytitle as
    previously), then em-dash, then the Refpurpose. Closes #1212562.

    Modified: fo/refentry.xsl,1.30 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added output of Releaseinfo to recto titlepage ("copyright" page) for Book
    in FO output. This makes it consistent with HTML output. Closes #1327034.
    Thanks to Paul DuBois for reporting.

    Modified: fo/titlepage.templates.xml,1.28 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added condition for setting block-progression-dimension.minimum on
    table-row, instead of height, when fop1.extensions is non-zero. For an
    explanation of the reason for the change, see:
    http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/Troubleshooting/CommonLogMessages

    Modified: fo/pagesetup.xsl,1.59 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added new refclass.suppress param for suppressing display of Refclass in
    HTML and FO output. Did not add it to manpages because manpages stylesheet
    is currently just silently ignoring Refclass anyway. Closes request
    #1461065. Thanks to Davor Ocelic (docelic) for reporting.

    Modified: fo/refentry.xsl,1.29; html/refentry.xsl,1.23 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Add support for keep-together PI to informal objects.

    Modified: fo/formal.xsl,1.50 - Robert Stayton

  * Add support for fop1.extensions.

    Modified: fo/formal.xsl,1.49; fo/graphics.xsl,1.44; fo/table.xsl,1.47 -
    Robert Stayton

  * Add support for fop1 bookmarks.

    Modified: fo/docbook.xsl,1.39 - Robert Stayton

  * Add fop1.extentions parameter to add support for fop development version.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.92; fo/param.xweb,1.105 - Robert Stayton

  * Start supporting fop development version, which will become fop version 1.

    Modified: fo/fop1.xsl,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Add template for task in mode="xref-to".

    Modified: fo/xref.xsl,1.63; html/xref.xsl,1.57 - Robert Stayton

  * table footnotes now also get footnote.properties attribute-set.

    Modified: fo/footnote.xsl,1.22 - Robert Stayton

  * Added index.separator named template to compute the separator punctuation
    based on locale.

    Modified: fo/autoidx.xsl,1.36 - Robert Stayton

  * Added support for link, olink, and xref within OO Classsynopsis and
    children. (Because DocBook NG/5 allows it).

    Modified: fo/synop.xsl,1.15; html/synop.xsl,1.19 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Support date as an inline

    Modified: fo/inline.xsl,1.43; html/inline.xsl,1.46 - Norman Walsh

  * Added new parameter keep.relative.image.uris

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.91; fo/param.xweb,1.104; html/param.ent,1.87;
    html/param.xweb,1.96; params/keep.relative.image.uris.xml,1.1 - Norman
    Walsh

  * Map Unicode space characters U+2000-U+200A to fo:leaders.

    Modified: fo/docbook.xsl,1.38; fo/passivetex.xsl,1.4; fo/spaces.xsl,1.1 -
    Jirka Kosek

  * Output a real em dash for em-dash dingbat (instead of two hypens).

    Modified: fo/fo.xsl,1.7 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Support default label width parameters for itemized and ordered lists

    Modified: fo/lists.xsl,1.64; fo/param.ent,1.90; fo/param.xweb,1.103;
    params/itemizedlist.label.width.xml,1.1;
    params/orderedlist.label.width.xml,1.1 - Norman Walsh

  * Generate localized title for Refsynopsisdiv if no appropriate Title
    descendant found in source. Closes #1212398. This change makes behavior
    for the Synopsis title consistent with the behavior of HTML and manpages
    output.

    Also, added xsl:use-attribute-sets="normal.para.spacing" to block
    generated for Cmdsynopsis output. Previously, that block had no spacing at
    all specified, which resulted it being crammed up to closely to the
    Synopsis head.

    Modified: fo/refentry.xsl,1.28; fo/synop.xsl,1.13 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added parameters to support localization of index item punctuation.

    Modified: fo/autoidx.xsl,1.35 - Robert Stayton

  * Added index.number.separator, index.range.separator, and
    index.term.separator parameters to support localization of punctuation in
    index entries.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.89; fo/param.xweb,1.102 - Robert Stayton

  * Added "Cross References" section in HTML doc (for consistency with the FO
    doc). Also, moved the existing FO "Cross References" section to follow the
    "Linking" section.

    Modified: fo/param.xweb,1.101; html/param.xweb,1.95 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added ID attribues to all Reference elements (e.g., id="tables" for the
    doc for section on Table params). So pages for all subsections of ref docs
    now have stable filenames instead of arbitrary generated filenames.

    Modified: fo/param.xweb,1.100; html/param.xweb,1.94 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry elements:

    variablelist.term.break.after: When the variablelist.term.break.after is
    non-zero, it will generate a line break after each term multi-term
    varlistentry.

    variablelist.term.separator: When a varlistentry contains multiple term
    elements, the string specified in the value of the
    variablelist.term.separator parameter is placed after each term except the
    last. The default is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress
    rendering of the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator
    to the empty string ("").

    These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
    multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.

    Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example "lots of
    long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having these options.

    Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.

    This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The default
    behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but it is possible
    (as always) that the change may introduce some new bugginess.

    params/variablelist.term.separator.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Add sidebar titlepage placeholder attset for styles.

    Modified: fo/titlepage.xsl,1.37 - Robert Stayton

  * Add titlepage for sidebar.

    Modified: fo/titlepage.templates.xml,1.27 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented RFE #1292615.

    Added bunch of new parameters (attribute sets) that affect list
    presentation: list.block.properties, itemizedlist.properties, orderedlist
    .properties, itemizedlist.label.properties and orderedlist.label
    .properties. Default behaviour of stylesheets has not been changed but
    further customizations will be much more easier.

  * Implemented RFE #1242092.

    You can enable crop marks in your document by setting crop.marks=1 and
    xep.extensions=1. Appearance of crop marks can be controlled by parameters
    crop.mark.bleed (6pt), crop.mark.offset (24pt) and crop.mark.width
    (0.5pt).

    Also there is new named template called user-xep-pis. You can overwrite it
    in order to produce some PIs that can control XEP as described in
    http://www.renderx.com/reference.html#Output_Formats

HTML

The following changes have been made to the html code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * implemented index.method parameter and three methods.

    Modified: html/autoidx.xsl,1.28 - Robert Stayton

  * added index.method parameter to support 3 indexing methods.

    Modified: html/param.ent,1.94; html/param.xweb,1.103 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented feature request #1072510 as a processing instruction to permit
    including external HTML content into HTML output.

    Modified: html/pi.xsl,1.9 - Robert Stayton

  * Added new parameter chunk.tocs.and.lots.has.title which controls presence
    of title in a separate chunk with ToC/LoT. Disabling title can be very
    useful if you are generating frameset output (well, yes those frames, but
    some customers really want them ;-).

    Modified: html/chunk-code.xsl,1.15; html/param.ent,1.93;
    html/param.xweb,1.102; params/chunk.tocs.and.lots.has.title.xml,1.1 -
    Jirka Kosek

  * Support dbhtml/dbfo start PI for orderedlist numbering in both HTML and FO

  * Allow ToC without title also for set and book.

    Modified: html/autotoc.xsl,1.37; html/division.xsl,1.12 - Jirka Kosek

  * Implemented floats uniformly for figure, example, equation and
    informalfigure, informalexample, and informalequation.

    Modified: html/formal.xsl,1.22 - Robert Stayton

  * Added the autotoc.label.in.hyperlink param.

    If the value of autotoc.label.in.hyperlink is non-zero, labels are
    included in hyperlinked titles in the TOC. If it is instead zero, labels
    are still displayed prior to the hyperlinked titles, but are not
    hyperlinked along with the titles.

    Closes patch #1065868. Thanks to anatoly techtonik for the patch.

    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added two new params: html.head.legalnotice.link.types and html.head.
    legalnotice.link.multiple.

    If the value of the generate.legalnotice.link is non-zero, then the
    stylesheet generates (in the head section of the HTML source) either a
    single HTML link element or, if the value of the html.head.legalnotice.
    link.multiple is non-zero, one link element for each link type specified.
    Each link has the following attributes:

    - a rel attribute whose value is derived from the value of html.head.
    legalnotice.link.types

    - an href attribute whose value is set to the URL of the file containing
    the legalnotice

    - a title attribute whose value is set to the title of the corresponding
    legalnotice (or a title programatically determined by the stylesheet)

    For example:

    <link rel="copyright" href="ln-id2524073.html" title="Legal Notice">

    Closes #1476450. Thanks to Sam Steingold.

  * Added new refclass.suppress param for suppressing display of Refclass in
    HTML and FO output. Did not add it to manpages because manpages stylesheet
    is currently just silently ignoring Refclass anyway. Closes request
    #1461065. Thanks to Davor Ocelic (docelic) for reporting.

    currently have no time to touch extensions code, so code is here to be
    enabled when extension is fixed also.

  * Added 3 parameters for overriding gentext for index punctuation.

    Modified: html/param.ent,1.89; html/param.xweb,1.98 - Robert Stayton

  * Added parameters to support localization of index item punctuation. Added
    index.separator named template to compute the separator punctuation based
    on locale.

    Modified: html/autoidx.xsl,1.27 - Robert Stayton

  * Added a <div class="{$class}-contents"> wrapper around output of contents
    of all formal objects. Also, added an optional <br class="{class}-break"/>
    linebreak after all formal objects.

    WARNING: Because this change places an additional DIV between the DIV
    wrapper for the equation and the equation contents, it may break some
    existing CSS stylesheets that have been created with the assumption that
    there would never be an intervening DIV there.

    The following is an example of what Equation output looks like as a result
    of the changes described above.

    <div class="equation"> <a name="three" id="three"></a>

    <p class="title"><b>(1.3)</b></p>

    <div class="equation-contents"> <span class="mathphrase">1+1=3</span>
    </div> </div><br class="equation-break">

    Rationale: These changes allow CSS control of the placement of the
    formal-object title relative to the formal-object contents. For example,
    using the CSS "float" property enables the title and contents to be
    rendered on the same line. Example stylesheet:

    .equation { margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; } .equation-contents {
    float: left; }

    .equation .title { margin-top: 0; float: right; margin-right: 200px; }

    .equation .title b { font-weight: normal; }

    .equation-break { clear: both; }

    Note that the purpose of the ".equation-break" class is to provide a way
    to clear off the floats.

    If you want to instead have the equation title rendered to the left of the
    equation contents, you can do something like this:

    .equation { margin-top: 20px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .equation-contents { float: right; }

    .equation .title { margin-top: 0; float: left; margin-right: 200px; }

    .equation .title b { font-weight: normal; }

    .equation-break { clear: both; }

    objects that don't have titles. True by default; I wonder if this will be
    too aggressive?

    filename for use in the image intrinsics extension.

  * Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry elements:

    variablelist.term.break.after: When the variablelist.term.break.after is
    non-zero, it will generate a line break after each term multi-term
    varlistentry.

    variablelist.term.separator: When a varlistentry contains multiple term
    elements, the string specified in the value of the
    variablelist.term.separator parameter is placed after each term except the
    last. The default is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress
    rendering of the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator
    to the empty string ("").

    These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
    multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.

    Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example "lots of
    long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having these options.

    Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.

    This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The default
    behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but it is possible
    (as always) that the change may introduce some new bugginess.

    to output inlines other than just "span". Acronym and Abbrev templates now
    use inline.charseq to output HTML "acronym" and "abbr" elements (instead
    of "span"). Closes #1305468. Thanks to Sam Steingold for suggesting the
    change.

    Modified: html/inline.xsl,1.45 - Michael(tm) Smith

Manpages

The following changes have been made to the manpages code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * Added the following params:

    - man.indent.width (string-valued) - man.indent.refsect (boolean) -
    man.indent.blurbs (boolean) - man.indent.lists (boolean) -
    man.indent.verbatims (boolean)

    Note that in earlier snapshots, man.indent.width was named
    man.indentation.default.value and the boolean params had names like
    man.indentation.*.adjust. Also the man.indent.blurbs param was called
    man.indentation.authors.adjust (or something).

    The behavior now is: If the value of a particular man.indent.* boolean
    param is non-zero, the corresponding contents (refsect*, list items,
    authorblurb/personblurb, vervatims) are displayed with a left margin
    indented by a width equal to the value of man.indent.width.

    Modified: params/man.indent.blurbs.xml,1.1; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.74;

    params/man.indent.width.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.table.footnotes.divider param.

    In each table that contains footenotes, the string specified by the man.
    table.footnotes.divider parameter is output before the list of footnotes
    for the table.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.73; manpages/links.xsl,1.6;
    manpages/param.ent,1.21; manpages/param.xweb,1.23;
    params/man.table.footnotes.divider.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added the man.output.in.separate.dir, man.output.base.dir, and
    man.output.subdirs.enabled parameters.

    The man.output.base.dir parameter specifies the base directory into which
    man-page files are output. The man.output.subdirs.enabled parameter
    controls whether the files are output in subdirectories within the base
    directory.

    The values of the man.output.base.dir and man.output.subdirs.enabled
    parameters are used only if the value of man.output.in.separate.dir
    parameter is non-zero. If the value of man.output.in.separate.dir is zero,
    man-page files are not output in a separate directory.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.72; manpages/param.ent,1.20;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.22; params/man.output.base.dir.xml,1.1;

  * Added man.font.table.headings and man.font.table.title params, for
    controlling font in table headings and titles.

    manpages/param.xweb,1.21; params/man.font.table.headings.xml,1.1;
    params/man.font.table.title.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

    specifying the roff font (for example, BI, B, I) for funcsynopsisinfo and
    funcprototype output.

  * Added man.segtitle.suppress param.

    If the value of man.segtitle.suppress is non-zero, then display of
    segtitle contents is suppressed in output.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.68; manpages/param.ent,1.17;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.19; params/man.segtitle.suppress.xml,1.1 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.output.manifest.enabled and man.output.manifest.filename params.

    If man.output.manifest.enabled is non-zero, a list of filenames for man
    pages generated by the stylesheet transformation is written to the file
    named by man.output.manifest.filename

    params/man.output.manifest.filename.xml,1.1;
    tools/make/Makefile.DocBook,1.4 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added refentry.meta.get.quietly param.

    If zero (the default), notes and warnings about "missing" markup are
    generated during gathering of refentry metadata. If non-zero, the metadata
    is gathered "quietly" -- that is, the notes and warnings are suppressed.

    NOTE: If you are processing a large amount of refentry content, you may be
    able to speed up processing significantly by setting a non-zero value for
    refentry.meta.get.quietly.

    Modified: common/refentry.xsl,1.17; manpages/param.ent,1.15;

  * Changed names of all boolean indentation params to man.indent.* Also
    discarded individual man.indent.*.value params and switched to just using
    a common man.indent.width param (3n by default).

    man files are output in separate directory.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.65; manpages/utility.xsl,1.14 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added options for controlling indentation of verbatim output. Controlled
    through the man.indentation.verbatims.adjust and
    man.indentation.verbatims.value params. Closes #1242997

    Modified: manpages/block.xsl,1.15; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.64 - Michael(tm)
    Smith

  * Added options for controlling indentation in lists and in *blurb output in
    the AUTHORS section. Controlled through the man.indentation.lists.adjust,
    man.indentation.lists.value, man.indentation.authors.adjust, and
    man.indentation.authors.value parameters. Default is 3 characters (instead
    of the roff default of 8 characters). Closes #1449369.

    Also, removed the indent that was being set on informalexample outuput. I
    will instead add an option for indenting verbatims, which I think is what
    the informalexample indent was intended for originally.

    manpages/info.xsl,1.18; manpages/lists.xsl,1.28 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Changed line-spacing call before synopfragment to use ".sp -1n" ("n" units
    specified) instead of plain ".sp -1"

    Modified: manpages/synop.xsl,1.28 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added support for writing man files into a specific output directory and
    into appropriate subdirectories within that output directory. Controlled
    through the man.base.dir parameter (similar to the base.dir support in the
    HTML stylesheet) and the man.subdirs.enabled parameter, which
    automatically determines the name of an appropriate subdir (for example,
    man/man7, man/man1, etc.) based on the section number/manvolnum of the
    source Refentry.

    Closes #1255036 and #1170317. Thanks to Denis Bradford for the original
    feature request, and to Costin Stroie for submitting a patch that was very
    helpful in implementing the support.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.62; manpages/utility.xsl,1.13 -

  * Refined XPath statements and notification messages for refentry metadata
    handling.

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.59; common/refentry.xsl,1.14;
    manpages/docbook.xsl,1.61; manpages/other.xsl,1.17 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added support for copyright and legalnotice. The manpages stylesheets now
    output a COPYRIGHT section, after the AUTHORS section, if a copyright or
    legalnotice is found in the source. The section contains the copyright
    contents followed by the legalnotice contents. Closes #1450209.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.59; manpages/info.xsl,1.17 - Michael(tm)
    Smith

  * Drastically reworked all of the XPath expressions used in refentry
    metadata gathering -- completely removed $parentinfo and turned $info into
    a set of nodes that includes the *info contents of the Refentry plus the
    *info contents all all of its ancestor elements. The basic XPath
    expression now used throughout is (using the example of checking for a
    date):

    (($info[//date])[last()]/date)[1].

    That selects the "last" *info/date date in document order -- that is, the
    one eitther on the Refentry itself or on the closest ancestor to the
    Refentry.

    It's likely this change may break some things; may need to pick up some
    pieces later.

    Also, changed the default value for the man.th.extra2.max.length from 40
    to 30.

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.58; common/refentry.xsl,1.7;

    Smith

  * Fixed handling of table footnotes. With this checkin, the table support in
    the manpages stylesheet is now basically feature complete. So this change
    closes request #619532, "No support for tables" -- the oldest currently
    open manpages feature request, submitted by Ben Secrest (blsecres) on
    2002-10-07. Congratulations to me [patting myself on the back].

    Modified: manpages/block.xsl,1.11; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.55;
    manpages/table.xsl,1.15 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added handling for table titles. Also fixed handling of nested tables;
    nest tables are now "extracted" and displayed just after their parent
    tables.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.54; manpages/table.xsl,1.14 - Michael(tm)
    Smith

  * Added option for turning off bold formatting in Funcsynopsis. Boldface
    formatting in function synopsis is mandated in the man(7) man page and is
    used almost universally in existing man pages. Despite that, it really
    does look like crap to have an entire Funcsynopsis output in bold, so I
    added params for turning off the bold formatting and/or replacing it with
    a different roff special font (e.g., "RI" for alternating roman/italic
    instead of the default "BI" for alternating bold/italic). The new params
    are "man.funcprototype.font" and "man.funcsynopsisinfo.font". To be
    documented later.

    Closes #1452247. Thanks to Joe Orton for the feature request.

  * Use AUTHORS instead of AUTHOR if we have multiple people to attribute.
    Also, fixed checking such that we generate author section even if we don't
    have an author (as long as there is at least one other person/entity we
    can put in the section). Also adjusted assembly of content for Author
    metainfo field such that we now not only use author, but try to find a
    "best match" if we can't find an author name to put there.

    Closes #1233592. Thanks to Sam Steingold for the request.

    Modified: manpages/info.xsl,1.12 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Changes for request #1243027, "Impove handling of AUTHOR section." This
    adds support for Collab, Corpauthor, Corpcredt, Orgname, Publishername,
    and Publisher. Also adds support for output of Affiliation and its
    children, and support for using gentext strings for auto-attributing roles
    (Author, Editor, Publisher, Translator, etc.). Also did a lot of code
    cleanup and modularization of all the AUTHOR handling code. And fixed a
    bug that was causing Author info to not be picked up correctly for
    metainfo comment we embed in man-page source.

    Modified: manpages/info.xsl,1.11 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Support bold output for "emphasis remap='B'". (because Eric Raymond's
    doclifter(1) tool converts groff source marked up with ".B" request or
    "\fB" escapes to DocBook "emphasis remap='B'".)

    Modified: manpages/inline.xsl,1.14 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added support for Segmentedlist. Details: Output is tabular, with no
    option for "list" type output. Output for Segtitle elements can be
    supressed by setting man.segtitle.suppress. If Segtitle content is output,
    it is rendered in italic type (not bold because not all terminals support
    bold and so italic ensures the stand out on those terminals). Extra space
    (.sp line) at end of table code ensures that it gets handled correctly in
    the case where its source is the child of a Para. Closes feature-request
    #1400097. Thanks to Daniel Leidert for the patch and push, and to Alastair
    Rankine for filing the original feature request.

  * Improved handling or Author/Editor/Othercredit.

    Reworked content of (non-visible) comment added at top of each page
    (metadata stuff).

    Added support for generating a manifest file (useful for cleaning up after
    builds, etc.)

    manpages/other.xsl,1.12; manpages/utility.xsl,1.6 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry elements:

    variablelist.term.break.after: When the variablelist.term.break.after is
    non-zero, it will generate a line break after each term multi-term
    varlistentry.

    variablelist.term.separator: When a varlistentry contains multiple term
    elements, the string specified in the value of the
    variablelist.term.separator parameter is placed after each term except the
    last. The default is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress
    rendering of the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator
    to the empty string ("").

    These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
    multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.

    Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example "lots of
    long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having these options.

    Also, added normalize-space() call to processing of each term.

    This change affects all output formats (HTML, PDF, manpages). The default
    behavior should pretty much remain the same as before, but it is possible
    (as always) that the change may introduce some new bugginess.

Params

The following changes have been made to the params code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * New parameters to set header/footer table minimum height.

    Modified: params/footer.table.height.xml,1.1;
    params/header.table.height.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Support multiple indexing methods for different languages.

    Modified: params/index.method.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Remove qandaset and qandadiv from generate.toc for fo output because
    formerly it wasn't working, but now it is and the default behavior should
    stay the same.

    Modified: params/generate.toc.xml,1.8 - Robert Stayton

  * add support for page number references to link element too.

    Modified: params/insert.link.page.number.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Add support for more characters to hyphen on when ulink.hyphenate is
    turned on.

    Modified: params/ulink.hyphenate.chars.xml,1.1;
    params/ulink.hyphenate.xml,1.3 - Robert Stayton

  * New attribute-set to format biblioentry and bibliomixed.

    Modified: params/biblioentry.properties.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Added new parameter chunk.tocs.and.lots.has.title which controls presence
    of title in a separate chunk with ToC/LoT. Disabling title can be very
    useful if you are generating frameset output (well, yes those frames, but
    some customers really want them ;-).

    Modified: html/chunk-code.xsl,1.15; html/param.ent,1.93;
    html/param.xweb,1.102; params/chunk.tocs.and.lots.has.title.xml,1.1 -
    Jirka Kosek

  * Added new attribute set toc.line.properties for controlling appearance of
    lines in ToC/LoT

    Modified: params/toc.line.properties.xml,1.1 - Jirka Kosek

  * Allow table footnotes to have different properties from regular footnotes.

    Modified: params/table.footnote.properties.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Set properties for pgwide="1" objects.

    Modified: params/pgwide.properties.xml,1.1 - Robert Stayton

  * Added the autotoc.label.in.hyperlink param.

    If the value of autotoc.label.in.hyperlink is non-zero, labels are
    included in hyperlinked titles in the TOC. If it is instead zero, labels
    are still displayed prior to the hyperlinked titles, but are not
    hyperlinked along with the titles.

    Closes patch #1065868. Thanks to anatoly techtonik for the patch.

    Modified: html/autotoc.xsl,1.36; html/param.ent,1.92;
    html/param.xweb,1.101; params/autotoc.label.in.hyperlink.xml,1.1 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added two new params: html.head.legalnotice.link.types and html.head.
    legalnotice.link.multiple.

    If the value of the generate.legalnotice.link is non-zero, then the
    stylesheet generates (in the head section of the HTML source) either a
    single HTML link element or, if the value of the html.head.legalnotice.
    link.multiple is non-zero, one link element for each link type specified.
    Each link has the following attributes:

    - a rel attribute whose value is derived from the value of html.head.
    legalnotice.link.types

    - an href attribute whose value is set to the URL of the file containing
    the legalnotice

    - a title attribute whose value is set to the title of the corresponding
    legalnotice (or a title programatically determined by the stylesheet)

    For example:

    <link rel="copyright" href="ln-id2524073.html" title="Legal Notice">

    Closes #1476450. Thanks to Sam Steingold.

    Modified: html/chunk-common.xsl,1.45; html/param.ent,1.91;
    html/param.xweb,1.100; params/generate.legalnotice.link.xml,1.4;
    params/html.head.legalnotice.link.multiple.xml,1.1;
    params/html.head.legalnotice.link.types.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added the following params:

    - man.indent.width (string-valued) - man.indent.refsect (boolean) -
    man.indent.blurbs (boolean) - man.indent.lists (boolean) -
    man.indent.verbatims (boolean)

    Note that in earlier snapshots, man.indent.width was named
    man.indentation.default.value and the boolean params had names like
    man.indentation.*.adjust. Also the man.indent.blurbs param was called
    man.indentation.authors.adjust (or something).

    The behavior now is: If the value of a particular man.indent.* boolean
    param is non-zero, the corresponding contents (refsect*, list items,
    authorblurb/personblurb, vervatims) are displayed with a left margin
    indented by a width equal to the value of man.indent.width.

    Modified: params/man.indent.blurbs.xml,1.1; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.74;
    manpages/info.xsl,1.20; manpages/lists.xsl,1.30; manpages/other.xsl,1.20;

    params/man.indent.width.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.table.footnotes.divider param.

    In each table that contains footenotes, the string specified by the man.
    table.footnotes.divider parameter is output before the list of footnotes
    for the table.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.73; manpages/links.xsl,1.6;
    manpages/param.ent,1.21; manpages/param.xweb,1.23;
    params/man.table.footnotes.divider.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added the man.output.in.separate.dir, man.output.base.dir, and
    man.output.subdirs.enabled parameters.

    The man.output.base.dir parameter specifies the base directory into which
    man-page files are output. The man.output.subdirs.enabled parameter
    controls whether the files are output in subdirectories within the base
    directory.

    The values of the man.output.base.dir and man.output.subdirs.enabled
    parameters are used only if the value of man.output.in.separate.dir
    parameter is non-zero. If the value of man.output.in.separate.dir is zero,
    man-page files are not output in a separate directory.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.72; manpages/param.ent,1.20;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.22; params/man.output.base.dir.xml,1.1;
    params/man.output.in.separate.dir.xml,1.1;
    params/man.output.subdirs.enabled.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.font.table.headings and man.font.table.title params, for
    controlling font in table headings and titles.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.71; manpages/param.ent,1.19;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.21; params/man.font.table.headings.xml,1.1;
    params/man.font.table.title.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.font.funcsynopsisinfo and man.font.funcprototype params, for
    specifying the roff font (for example, BI, B, I) for funcsynopsisinfo and
    funcprototype output.

    Modified: manpages/block.xsl,1.19; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.69;

    params/man.font.funcsynopsisinfo.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Changed to select="0" in refclass.suppress (instead of ..>0</..)

    Modified: params/refclass.suppress.xml,1.3 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.segtitle.suppress param.

    If the value of man.segtitle.suppress is non-zero, then display of
    segtitle contents is suppressed in output.

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.68; manpages/param.ent,1.17;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.19; params/man.segtitle.suppress.xml,1.1 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added man.output.manifest.enabled and man.output.manifest.filename params.

    If man.output.manifest.enabled is non-zero, a list of filenames for man
    pages generated by the stylesheet transformation is written to the file
    named by man.output.manifest.filename

    Modified: manpages/docbook.xsl,1.67; manpages/other.xsl,1.19;
    manpages/param.ent,1.16; manpages/param.xweb,1.18;
    params/man.output.manifest.enabled.xml,1.1;
    params/man.output.manifest.filename.xml,1.1;
    tools/make/Makefile.DocBook,1.4 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added refclass.suppress param.

    If the value of refclass.suppress is non-zero, then display refclass
    contents is suppressed in output. Affects HTML and FO output only.

    Modified: fo/param.ent,1.93; fo/param.xweb,1.106; html/param.ent,1.90;
    html/param.xweb,1.99; params/refclass.suppress.xml,1.1 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added refentry.meta.get.quietly param.

    If zero (the default), notes and warnings about "missing" markup are
    generated during gathering of refentry metadata. If non-zero, the metadata
    is gathered "quietly" -- that is, the notes and warnings are suppressed.

    NOTE: If you are processing a large amount of refentry content, you may be
    able to speed up processing significantly by setting a non-zero value for
    refentry.meta.get.quietly.

    Modified: common/refentry.xsl,1.17; manpages/param.ent,1.15;
    manpages/param.xweb,1.17; params/refentry.meta.get.quietly.xml,1.1 -
    Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added support for "software" and "sectdesc" class values on refmiscinfo;
    "software" is treated identically to "source", and "setdesc" is treated
    identically to "manual".

    Modified: common/refentry.xsl,1.10;
    params/man.th.extra2.max.length.xml,1.3;
    params/refentry.source.name.profile.xml,1.4 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Drastically reworked all of the XPath expressions used in refentry
    metadata gathering -- completely removed $parentinfo and turned $info into
    a set of nodes that includes the *info contents of the Refentry plus the
    *info contents all all of its ancestor elements. The basic XPath
    expression now used throughout is (using the example of checking for a
    date):

    (($info[//date])[last()]/date)[1].

    That selects the "last" *info/date date in document order -- that is, the
    one eitther on the Refentry itself or on the closest ancestor to the
    Refentry.

    It's likely this change may break some things; may need to pick up some
    pieces later.

    Also, changed the default value for the man.th.extra2.max.length from 40
    to 30.

    Modified: common/common.xsl,1.58; common/refentry.xsl,1.7;
    params/man.th.extra2.max.length.xml,1.2;

    params/refentry.version.profile.xml,1.2; manpages/docbook.xsl,1.58;
    manpages/other.xsl,1.15 - Michael(tm) Smith

  * Added option for turning off bold formatting in Funcsynopsis. Boldface
    formatting in function synopsis is mandated in the man(7) man page and is
    used almost universally in existing man pages. Despite that, it really
    does look like crap to have an entire Funcsynopsis output in bold, so I
    added params for turning off the bold formatting and/or replacing it with
    a different roff special font (e.g., "RI" for alternating roman/italic
    instead of the default "BI" for alternating bold/italic). The new params
    are "man.funcprototype.font" and "man.funcsynopsisinfo.font". To be
    documented later.

    Closes #1452247. Thanks to Joe Orton for the feature request.

    too aggressive?

  * Added two new parameters for handling of multi-term varlistentry elements:

    variablelist.term.break.after: When the variablelist.term.break.after is
    non-zero, it will generate a line break after each term multi-term
    varlistentry.

    variablelist.term.separator: When a varlistentry contains multiple term
    elements, the string specified in the value of the
    variablelist.term.separator parameter is placed after each term except the
    last. The default is ", " (a comma followed by a space). To suppress
    rendering of the separator, set the value of variablelist.term.separator
    to the empty string ("").

    These parameters are primarily intended to be useful if you have
    multi-term varlistentries that have long terms.

    Closes #1306676. Thanks to Sam Steingold for providing an example "lots of
    long terms" doc that demonstrated the value of having these options.

  * Convert 'no' to string in default value.

    Modified: params/olink.doctitle.xml,1.4 - Robert Stayton

  * Implemented RFE #1292615.

    Added bunch of new parameters (attribute sets) that affect list
    presentation: list.block.properties, itemizedlist.properties, orderedlist
    .properties, itemizedlist.label.properties and orderedlist.label
    .properties. Default behaviour of stylesheets has not been changed but
    further customizations will be much more easier.

    You can enable crop marks in your document by setting crop.marks=1 and
    xep.extensions=1. Appearance of crop marks can be controlled by parameters
    crop.mark.bleed (6pt), crop.mark.offset (24pt) and crop.mark.width
    (0.5pt).

    Also there is new named template called user-xep-pis. You can overwrite it
    in order to produce some PIs that can control XEP as described in

Profiling

The following changes have been made to the profiling code since the 1.69.1
release.

  * Profiling now works together with namespace stripping (V5 documents).
    Namespace striping should work with all stylesheets named profile-, even
    if they are not supporting namespace stripping in a non-profiling variant.

    Modified: profiling/profile-mode.xsl,1.4; profiling/xsl2profile.xsl,1.7 -
    Jirka Kosek

  * Moved profiling stage out of templates. This make possible to reuse
    profiled content by several templates and still maintaing node indentity
    (needed for example for HTML Help where content is processed multiple
    times).

    I don't know why this was not on the top level before. Maybe some XSLT
    processors choked on it. I hope this will be OK now.

    Modified: profiling/xsl2profile.xsl,1.5 - Jirka Kosek

Release 1.69.1

This release is a minor bug-fix update to the 1.69.0 release. Along with bug
fixes, it includes one configuration-parameter change: The default value of
the annotation.support parameter is now 0 (off). The reason for that change is
that there have been reports that annotation handling is causing a significant
performance degradation in processing of large documents with xsltproc.

Release 1.69.0

The release includes major feature changes, particularly in the manpages
stylesheets, as well as a large number of bug fixes.

As with all DocBook Project dot zero releases, this is an experimental
release .

Common

  * This release adds localizations for the following languages: Albanian,
    Amharic, Azerbaijani, Hindi, Irish (Gaelic), Gujarati, Kannada, Mongolian,
    Oriya, Punjabi, Tagalog, Tamil, and Welsh.

  * Added support for specifying number format for auto labels for chapter,
    appendix, part, and preface. Contolled with the appendix.autolabel,
    chapter.autolabel, part.autolabel, and preface.autolabel parameters.

  * Added basic support for biblioref cross referencing.

  * Added support for align on caption in mediaobject.

  * Added support for processing documents that use the DocBook V5 namespace.

  * Added support for termdef and mathphrase.

  * EXPERIMENTAL: Incorporated the Slides and Website stylesheets into the
    DocBook XSL stylesheets package. So, for example, Website documents can
    now be processed using the following URI for the driver Website
    tabular.xsl file:

    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/website/tabular.xsl

  * A procedure without a title is now treated as an informal procedure
    (meaning that it is not added to any generated list of procedures and
    has no affect on numbering of generated labels for other procedures).

  * docname is no longer added to olink when pointing to a root element.

  * Added support for generation of choice separator in inline simplelist.
    This enables auto-generation of an appropriate localized choice
    separator (for example, and or or) before the final item in an inline
    simplelist.

    To indicate that you want a choice separator generated for a particular
    list, you need to put a processing instruction (PI) of the form
    <?dbchoice choice="foo"?> as a child of the list. For example:

      <para>Choose from
      ONE and ONLY ONE of the following:
      <simplelist type="inline">
      <?dbchoice choice="or" ?>
      <member>A</member>
      <member>B</member>
      <member>C</member>.</simplelist></para>

    Output (for English):

        Choose from ONE and only ONE of the following choices: A, B, or C.

    As a temporary workaround for the fact that most of the DocBook
    non-English locale files don't have a localization for the word or, you
    can put in a literal string to be used; example for French:
    <?dbchoice choice="ou">. That is, use ou instead of or.

FO

  * Added content-type property to external-graphic element, based on
    imagedata format attribute.

  * Added support for generating <rx:meta-field creator="$VERSION"/> field for
    XEP output. This makes the DocBook XSL stylesheet version information
    available through the Document Properties menu in Acrobat Reader and other
    PDF viewers.

  * Trademark symbol handling made consistent with handling of same in HTML
    stylesheets. Prior to this change, if you processed a document that
    contained no value for the class attribute on the trademark element, the
    HTML stylesheets would default to rendering a superscript TM symbol after
    the trademark contents, but the FO stylesheets would render nothing.

  * Added support for generating XEP bookmarks for refentry.

  * Added support for HTML markup table border attribute, applied to each
    table cell.

  * The table.width template can now sum column specs if none use % or *.

  * Added fox:destination extension inside fox:outline to support linking to
    internal destinations.

  * Added support for customizing abstract with property sets. Controlled with
    the abstract.properties and abstract.title.properties parameters.

  * Add footnotes in table title to table footnote set, and add support for
    table footnotes to HTML table markup.

  * Added support for title in glosslist.

  * Added support for itemizedlist symbol none.

  * Implemented the new graphical.admonition.properties and
    nongraphical.admonition.properties attribute sets.

  * Added id to formalpara and some other blocks that were missing it.

  * Changed the anchor template to output fo:inline instead of fo:wrapper.

  * Added support for toc.max.depth parameter.

Help

  * Eclipse Help: Added support for generating olink database.

HTML

  * Added a first cut at support in HTML output for DocBook 5 style annotation
    s. Controlled using the annotation.support parameter, and implemented
    using JavaScript and CSS styling. For more details, see the documentation
    for the annotation.js, annotation.css, annotation.graphic.open, and
    annotation.graphic.close parameters.

  * Generate client-side image map for imageobjectco with areas using calspair
    units

  * Added support for <?img.src.path?> PI.

  * Added support for passing img.src.path to DocBook Java XSLT image
    extensions when appropriate. Controlled using the
    graphicsize.use.img.src.path parameter.

  * Added support for (not valid for DocBook 4) xlink:href on area and (not
    valid for DocBook 4) alt in area.

  * Added new parameter default.table.frame to control table framing if there
    is no frame attribute on a table.

  * Added initial, experimental support for generating content for the HTML
    title attribute from content of the alt element. This change adds support
    for the following inline elements only (none of them are block elements):
    abbrev, accel, acronym, action, application, authorinitials, beginpage,
    citation, citerefentry, citetitle, city, classname, code, command,
    computeroutput, constant, country, database, email, envar, errorcode,
    errorname, errortext, errortype, exceptionname, fax, filename, firstname,
    firstterm, foreignphrase, function, glossterm, guibutton, guiicon,
    guilabel, guimenu, guimenuitem, guisubmenu, hardware, honorific,
    interface, interfacename, keycap, keycode, keysym, lineage, lineannotation
    , literal, markup, medialabel, methodname, mousebutton, option, optional,
    otheraddr, othername, package, parameter, personname, phone, pob, postcode
    , productname, productnumber, prompt, property, quote, refentrytitle,
    remark, replaceable, returnvalue, tag, shortcut, state, street,
    structfield, structname, subscript, superscript, surname, symbol,
    systemitem, tag, termdef, token, trademark, type, uri, userinput, varname,
    and wordasword

  * Added support for chunking revhistory into separate file (similar to the
    support for doing same with legalnotice). Patch from Thomas Schraitle.
    Controlled through new generate.revhistory.link parameter.

  * l10n.xsl: Made language codes RFC compliant. Added a new boolean config
    parameter, l10n.lang.value.rfc.compliant. If it is non-zero (the default),
    any underscore in a language code will be converted to a hyphen in HTML
    output. If it is zero, the language code will be left as-is.

man

This release closes out 44 manpages stylesheet bug reports and feature
requests. It adds more than 35 new configuration parameters for controlling
aspects of man-page output -- including hyphenation and justification,
handling of links, conversion of Unicode characters, and contents of man-page
headers and footers.

  * New options for globally disabling/enabling hyphenation and justification:
    man.justify and man.hyphenate.

    Note that the default for the both of those is zero (off), because
    justified text looks good only when it is also hyphenated; to quote the
    Hyphenation node from the groff info page:

        Since the odds are not great for finding a set of words, for every
        output line, which fit nicely on a line without inserting excessive
        amounts of space between words, `gtroff' hyphenates words so that it
        can justify lines without inserting too much space between words.

    The problem is that groff can end up hyphenating a lot of things that you
    don't want hyphenated (variable names and command names, for example).
    Keeping both justification and hyphenation disabled ensures that hyphens
    won't get inserted where you don't want to them, and you don't end up with
    lines containing excessive amounts of space between words. These default
    settings run counter to how most existing man pages are formatted. But
    there are some notable exceptions, such as the perl man pages.

  * Added parameters for controlling hyphenation of computer inlines,
    filenames, and URLs. By default, even when hyphenation is enabled
    (globally), hyphenation is now suppressed for "computer inlines"
    (currently, just classname, constant, envar, errorcode, option,
    replaceable, userinput, type, and varname, and for filenames, and for URLs
    from link. It can be (re)enabled using the man.hyphenate.computer.inlines,
    man.hyphenate.filenames, and man.hyphenate.urls parameters.

  * Implemented a new system for replacing Unicode characters. There are two
    parts to the new system: a string substitution map for doing essential
    replacements, and a character map that can optionally be disabled and
    enabled.

    The new system fixes all open bugs that had to do with literal Unicode
    numbered entities such as &#8220; and &#8221; showing up in output, and
    greatly expands the ability of the stylesheets to generate good roff
    equivalents for Unicode symbols and special characters.

    Here are some details...

    The previous manpages mechanism for replacing Unicode symbols and special
    characters with roff equivalents (the replace-entities template) was not
    scalable and not complete. The mechanism handled a somewhat arbitrary
    selection of less than 20 or so Unicode characters. But there are
    potentially more than 800 Unicode special characters that have some groff
    equivalent they can be mapped to. And there are about 34 symbols in the
    Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) block alone. Users might reasonably expect that if
    they include any of those Latin-1 characters in their DocBook source
    documents, they will get correctly converted to known roff equivalents in
    output.

    In addition to those common symbols, certain users may have a need to use
    symbols from other Unicode blocks. Say, somebody who is documenting an
    application related to math might need to use a bunch of symbols from the
    Mathematical Operators Unicode block (there are about 65 characters in
    that block that have reasonable roff equivalents). Or somebody else might
    really like Dingbats -- such as the checkmark character -- and so might
    use a bunch of things from the Dingbat block (141 characters in that
    that have roff equivalents or that can at least be degraded somewhat
    gracefully into roff).

    So, the old replace-entities mechanism was replaced with a completely
    different mechanism that is based on use of two maps: a substitution
    map and a character map (the latter in a format compliant with the XSLT
    2.0 spec and therefore completely forward compatible with XSLT 2.0).

    The substitution map is controlled through the man.string.subst.map
    parameter, and is used to replace things like the backslash character
    (which needs special handling to prevent it from being interpreted as a
    roff escape). The substitution map cannot be disabled, because disabling
    it will cause the output to be broken. However, you can add to it and
    change it if needed.

    The character map mechanism, on the other hand, can be completely
    disabled. It is enabled by default, and, by default, does replacement of
    all Latin-1 symbols, along with most special spaces, dashes, and quotes
    (about 75 characters by default). Also, you can optionally enable a full
    character map that provides support for converting all 800 or so of the
    characters that have some reasonable groff equivalent.

    The character-map mechanism is controlled through the following
    parameters:

    man.charmap.enabled

        turns character-map support on/off

    man.charmap.use.subset

        specifies that a subset of the character map is used instead of the
        full map

    man.charmap.subset.profile

        specifies profile of character-map subset

    man.charmap.uri

        specifies an alternate character map to use instead of the standard
        character map provided in the distribution

  * Implemented out-of-line handling of display of URLs for links (currently,
    only for ulink). This gives you three choices for handling of links:

     1. Number and list links. Each link is numbered inline, with a number in
        square brackets preceding the link contents, and a numbered list of
        all links is added to the end of the document.

     2. Only list links. Links are not numbered, but an (unnumbered) list of
        links is added to the end of the document.

     3. Suppress links. Don't number links and don't add any list of links to
        the end of the document.

    You can also choose whether links should be underlined. The default is
    the works -- list, number, and underline links. You can use the
    man.links.list.enabled, man.links.are.numbered, and
    man.links.are.underlined parameters to change the defaults. The default
    heading for the link list is REFERENCES. You can be change that using the
    man.links.list.heading parameter.

  * Changed default output encoding to UTF-8. This does not mean that man
    pages are output in raw UTF-8, because the character map is applied before
    final output, causing all UTF-8 characters covered in the map to be
    converted to roff equivalents.

  * Added support for processing refsect3 and formalpara and nested refsection
    elements, down to any arbitrary level of nesting.

  * Output of the NAME and SYNOPSIS and AUTHOR headings and the headings for
    admonitions (note, caution, etc.) are no longer hard-coded for English.
    Instead, headings are generated for those in the correct locale (just as
    the FO and HTML stylesheets do).

  * Re-worked mechanism for assembling page headers/footers (the contents of
    the .TH macro title line).

    Here are some details...

    All man pages contain a .TH roff macro whose contents are used for
    rendering the title line displayed in the header and footer of each
    page. Here are a couple of examples of real-world man pages that have
    useful page headers/footers:

      gtk-options(7)    GTK+ User's Manual   gtk-options(7) <-- header
      GTK+ 1.2              2003-10-20       gtk-options(7) <-- footer

      svgalib(7)       Svgalib User Manual       svgalib(7) <-- header
      Svgalib 1.4.1      16 December 1999        svgalib(7) <-- footer

    And here are the terms with which the groff_man(7) man page refers to the
    various parts of the header/footer:

      title(section)  extra3  title(section)  <- header
      extra2          extra1  title(section)  <- footer

    Or, using the names with which the man(7) man page refers to those same
    fields:

      title(section)  manual  title(section)  <- page header
      source          date    title(section)  <- page footer

    The easiest way to control the contents of those fields is to mark up your
    refentry content like the following (note that this is a minimal
    example).

      <refentry>
        <info>
          <date>2003-10-20</date> 1
        </info>
        <refmeta>
          <refentrytitle>gtk-options</refentrytitle> 2
          <manvolnum>7</manvolnum> 3
          <refmiscinfo class="source-name">GTK+</refmiscinfo> 4
          <refmiscinfo class="version">1.2</refmiscinfo> 5
          <refmiscinfo class="manual">GTK+ User's Manual</refmiscinfo> 6
        </refmeta>
        <refnamediv>
          <refname>gtk-options</refname>
          <refpurpose>Standard Command Line Options for GTK+ Programs</refpurpose>
        </refnamediv>
        <refsect1>
          <title>Description</title>
          <para>This manual page describes the command line options, which
          are common to all GTK+ based applications.</para>
        </refsect1>
      </refentry>

    1  Sets the date part of the header/footer.

    2  Sets the title part.

    3  Sets the section part.

    4  Sets the source name part.

    5  Sets the version part.

    6  Sets the manual part.

    Below are explanations of the steps the stylesheets take to attempt to
    assemble and display good headers and footer. [In the descriptions, note
    that *info is the refentry info child (whatever its name), and
    parentinfo is the info child of its parent (again, whatever its name).]

    extra1 field (date)

        Content of the extra1 field is what shows up in the center footer
        position of each page. The man(7) man page describes it as the date
        of the last revision.

        To provide this content, if the refentry.date.profile.enabled is
        non-zero, the stylesheets check the value of refentry.date.profile.

        Otherwise, by default, they check for a date or pubdate not only in
        the *info contents, but also in the parentinfo contents.

        If a date cannot be found, the stylesheets now automatically generate
        a localized long format date, ensuring that this field always has
        content in output.

        However, if for some reason you want to suppress this field, you can
        do so by setting a non-zero value for man.th.extra1.suppress.

    extra2 field (source)

        On Linux systems and on systems with a modern groff, the content of
        the extra2 field are what shows up in the left footer position of
        each page.

        The man(7) man page describes this as the source of the command, and
        provides the following examples:

          o For binaries, use somwething like: GNU, NET-2, SLS Distribution,
            MCC Distribution.

          o For system calls, use the version of the kernel that you are
            currently looking at: Linux 0.99.11.

          o For library calls, use the source of the function: GNU, BSD 4.3,
            Linux DLL 4.4.1.

        In practice, there are many pages that simply have a version number in
        the source field. So, it looks like what we have is a two-part
        field, Name Version, where:

        Name

            product name (e.g., BSD) or org. name (e.g., GNU)

        Version

            version name

        Each part is optional. If the Name is a product name, then the Version
        is probably the version of the product. Or there may be no Name, in
        which case, if there is a Version, it is probably the version of the
        item itself, not the product it is part of. Or, if the Name is an
        organization name, then there probably will be no Version.

        To provide this content, if the refentry.source.name.profile.enabled
        and refentry.version.profile.enabled parameter are non-zero, the
        stylesheets check the value of refentry.source.name.profile
        refentry.version.profile.

        Otherwise, by default, they check the following places, in the
        following order:

         1. *info/productnumber

         2. *info/productnumber

         3. refmeta/refmiscinfo[@class = 'version']

         4. parentinfo/productnumber

         5. *info/productname

         6. parentinfo/productname

         7. refmeta/refmiscinfo

         8. [nothing found, so leave it empty]

    extra3 field

        On Linux systems and on systems with a modern groff, the content of
        the extra3 field are what shows up in the center header position of
        each page. Some man pages have extra2 content, some don't. If a
        particular man page has it, it is most often context data about some
        larger system the documented item belongs to (for example, the name or
        description of a group of related applications). The stylesheets now
        check the following places, in the following order, to look for
        content to add to the extra3 field.

         1. parentinfo/title

         2. parent's title

         3. refmeta/refmiscinfo

         4. [nothing found, so leave it empty]

  * Reworked *info gathering. For each refentry found, the stylesheets now
    cache its *info content, then check for any valid parent of it that might
    have metainfo content and cache that, if found; they then then do all
    further matches against those node-sets (rather than re-selecting the
    original *info nodes each time they are needed).

  * New option for breaking strings after forward slashes. This enables long
    URLs and pathnames to be broken across lines. Controlled through
    man.break.after.slash parameter.

  * Output for servicemark and trademark are now (SM) and (TM). There is a
    groff "\(tm" escape, but output from that is not acceptable.

  * New option for controlling the length of the title part of the .TH title
    line. Controlled through the man.th.title.max.length parameter.

  * New option for specifying output encoding of each man page; controlled
    with man.output.encoding (similar to the HTML chunker.output.encoding 
    parameter).

  * New option for suppressing filename messages when generating output;
    controlled with man.output.quietly (similar to the HTML chunk.quietly
    parameter).

  * The text of cross-references to first-level refentry (refsect1, top-level
    refsection, refnamediv, and refsynopsisdiv) are now capitalized.

  * Cross-references to refnamediv now use the localized NAME title instead of
    using the first refname child. This makes the output inconsistent with
    HTML and FO output, but for man-page output, it seems to make better sense
    to have the NAME. (It may actually make better sense to do it that way in
    HTML and FO output as well...)

  * Added support for processing funcparams.

  * Removed the space that was being output between funcdef and paramdef;
    example: was: float rand (void); now: float rand(void)

  * Turned off bold formatting for the type element when it occurs within a
    funcdef or paramdef

  * Corrected rendering of simplelist. Any <simplelist type="inline" instance
    is now rendered as a comma-separated list (also with an optional localized
    and or or before the last item -- see description elsewhere in these
    release notes). Any simplelist instance whose type is not inline is
    rendered as a one-column vertical list (ignoring the values of the type
    and columns attributes if present)

  * Comment added at top of roff source for each page now includes DocBook XSL
    stylesheets version number (as in the HTML stylesheets)

  * Made change to prevent sticky fonts changes. Now, when the manpages
    stylesheets encounter node sets that need to be boldfaced or italicized,
    they put the \fBfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR groff bold/italic instructions
    separately around each node in the set.

  * synop.xsl: Boldface everything in funcsynopsis output except parameters
    (which are in ital). The man(7) man page says:

        For functions, the arguments are always specified using italics, even
        in the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest of the function is specified
        in bold.

    A look through the contents of the man/man2 directory shows that most
    (all) existing pages do follow this everything in funcsynopsis bold
    rule. That means the type content and any punctuation (parens, semicolons,
    varargs) also must be bolded.

  * Removed code for adding backslashes before periods/dots in roff source,
    because backslashes in front of periods/dots in roff source are needed
    only in the very rare case where a period is the very first character in a
    line, without any space in front of it. A better way to deal with that
    rare case is for you to add a zero-width space in front of the offending
    dot(s) in your source

  * Removed special handling of the quote element. That was hard-coded to
    cause anything marked up with the quote element to be output preceded by
    two backticks and followed by two apostrophes -- that is, that old-school
    kludge for generating curly quotes in Emacs and in X-Windows fonts.
    While Emacs still seems to support that, I don't think X-Windows has for a
    long time now. And, anyway, it looks (and has always looked) like crap
    when viewed on a normal tty/console. In addition, it breaks localiztion of
    quote. By default, quote content is output with localized quotation marks,
    which, depending on the locale, may or may not be left and right double
    quotation marks.

  * Changed mappings for left and right single quotation marks. Those had
    previously been incorrectly mapped to the backtick (&#96;) and apostrophe
    (&39;) characters (for kludgy reasons -- see above). They are now
    correctly mapped to the \(oq and \(cq roff escapes. If you want the old
    (broken) behavior, you need to manually change the mappings for those in
    the value of the man.string.subst.map parameter.

  * Removed xref.xsl file. Now, of the various cross-reference elements, only
    the ulink element is handled differently; the rest are handled exactly as
    the HTML stylesheets handle them, except that no hypertext links are
    generated. (Because there is no equivalent hypertext mechanism is man
    pages.)

  * New option for making subheading dividers in generated roff source. The
    dividers are not visible in the rendered man page; they are just there to
    make the source readable. Controlled using man.subheading.divider.

  * Fixed many places where too much space was being added between lines.

Release 1.68.1

The release adds localization support for Farsi (thanks to Sina Heshmati) and
improved support for the XLink-based DocBook NG db:link element. Other than
that, it is a minor bug-fix update to the 1.68.0 release. The main thing it
fixes is a build error that caused the XSLT Java extensions to be jarred up
with the wrong package structure. Thanks to Jens Stavnstrup for quickly
reporting the problem, and to Mauritz Jeanson for investigating and finding
the cause.

Release 1.68.0

This release includes some features changes, particularly for FO/PDF output,
and a number of bug fixes.

FO

    set.flow.properties template.

  * Added support for xml:id

  * Added support for refdescriptor.

  * Added support for multiple refnamedivs.

  * Added index.entry.properties attribute-set to support customization of
    index entries.

  * $verbose parameter is now passed to most elements.

  * Added refentry to toc in part, as it is permitted by the DocBook
    schema/DTD.

  * Added backmatter elements and article to toc in part, since they are
    permitted by the DocBook schema/DTD.

  * Added mode="toc" for simplesect, since it is now permitted in the toc if
    simplesect.in.toc is set.

  * Moved hard-coded properties to nongraphical.admonintion.properties and
    graphical.admonition.properties attribute sets.

  * Added support for sidebar-width and float-type processing instructions in
    sidebar.

  * For tables with HTML markup elements, added support for dbfo bgcolor PI,
    the attribute-sets named table.properties, informaltable.properties,
    table.table.properties, and table.cell.padding. Also added support for the
    templates named table.cell.properties and table.cell.block.properties so
    that tabstyles can be implemented. Also added support for tables
    containing only tr instead of tbody with tr.

  * Added new paramater hyphenate.verbatim.characters which can specify
    characters after which a line break can occur in verbatim environments.
    This parameter can be used to extend the initial set of characters which
    contain only space and non-breakable space.

  * Added itemizedlist.label.markup to enable selection of different bullet
    symbol. Also added several potential bullet characters, commented out by
    default.

  * Enabled all id's in XEP output for external olinking.

Images

  * Added new SVG admonition graphics and navigation images.

Release 1.67.2

This release fixes a table bug introduced in the 1.67.1 release.

Release 1.67.1

This release includes a number of bug fixes.

The following lists provide details about API and feature changes.

FO

  * Tables: Inherited cell properties are now passed to the
    table.cell.properties template so they can be overridden by a
    customization.

  * Tables: Added support for bgcolor PI on table row element.

  * TOCs: Added new parameter simplesect.in.toc; default value of 0 causes
    simplesect to be omitted from TOCs; to cause simplesect to be included in
    TOCs, you must set the value of simplesect.in.toc to 1.Comment from Norm:

        Simplesect elements aren't supposed to appear in the ToC at all... The
        use case for simplesect is when, for example, every chapter in a book
        ends with "Exercises" or "For More Information" sections and you don't
        want those to appear in the ToC.

  * Sections: Reverted change that caused a variable reference to be used in a
    template match and rewrote code to preserve intended semantics.

  * Lists: Added workaround to prevent "* 0.60 + 1em" garbage in list output
    from PassiveTeX

  * Moved the literal attributes from component.title to the
    component.title.properties attribute-set so they can be customized.

  * Lists: Added glossdef's first para to special handling in
    fo:list-item-body.

HTML

  * TOCs: Added new parameter simplesect.in.toc; for details, see the list of
    FO changes for this release.

  * Indexing: Added new parameter index.prefer.titleabbrev; when set to 1,
    index references will use titleabbrev instead of title when available.

HTML Help

  * Added support for generating windows-1252-encoded output using Saxon; for
    more details, see the list of XSL Java extensions changes for this
    release.

man pages

  * Replaced named/numeric character-entity references for non-breaking space
    with groff equivalent (backslash-tilde).

XSL Java extensions

  * Saxon extensions: Added the Windows1252 class. It extends Saxon 6.5.x with
    the windows-1252 character set, which is particularly useful when
    generating HTML Help for Western European Languages (code from Pontus
    Haglund and contributed to the DocBook community by Sectra AB, Sweden).

    To use:

     1. Make sure that the Saxon 6.5.x jar file and the jar file for the
        DocBook XSL Java extensions are in your CLASSPATH

     2. Create a DocBook XSL customization layer -- a file named
        mystylesheet.xsl or whatever -- that, at a minimum, contains the
        following:

          <xsl:stylesheet
            xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
            version='1.0'>
            <xsl:import href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl"/>
            <xsl:output method="html" encoding="WINDOWS-1252" indent="no"/>
            <xsl:param name="htmlhelp.encoding" select="'WINDOWS-1252'"></xsl:param>
            <xsl:param name="chunker.output.encoding" select="'WINDOWS-1252'"></xsl:param>
            <xsl:param name="saxon.character.representation" select="'native'"></xsl:param>
          </xsl:stylesheet>

        Invoke Saxon with the encoding.windows-1252 Java system property set
        to com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252; for example

          java \
            -Dencoding.windows-1252=com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252 \
          com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet \
          mydoc.xml mystylesheet.xsl

        Or, for a more complete "real world" case showing other options you'll
        typically want to use:

          java \
            -Dencoding.windows-1252=com.nwalsh.saxon.Windows1252 \
            -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl \
            -Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl \
            -Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=com.icl.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl \
          com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet \
            -x org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader \
            -y org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader \
            -r org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver \
          mydoc.xml mystylesheet.xsl

        In both cases, the "mystylesheet.xsl" file should be a DocBook
        customization layer containing the parameters show in step 2.

  * Saxon extensions: Removed Saxon 8 extensions from release package

Release 1.67.0

  * A number of important bug fixes.

  * Added Saxon8 extensions

  * Enabled dbfo table-width on entrytbl in FO output

  * Added support for role=strong on emphasis in FO output

  * Added new FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim that can be used to turn on
    "intelligent" wrapping of verbatim environments.

  * Replaced all <tt></tt> output with <code></code>

  * Changed admon.graphic.width template to a mode so that different
    admonitions can have different graphical widths.

  * Deprecated the HTML shade.verbatim parameter (use CSS instead)

  * Wrapped ToC refentrytitle/refname and refpurpose in span with class
    values. This makes it possible to style them using a CSS stylesheet.

  * Use strong/em instead of b/i in HTML output

  * Added support for converting Emphasis to groff italic and Emphasis
    role='bold' to bold. Controlled by emphasis.propagates.style param, but
    not documented yet using litprog system. Will do that next (planning to
    add some other parameter-controllable options for hyphenation and handling
    of line spacing).

  * callout.graphics.number.limit.xml param: Changed the default from 10 to
    15.

  * verbatim.properties: Added hyphenate=false

  * Saxon and Xalan Text.java extensions: Added support for URIResolver() on
    insertfile href's

  * Added generated RELEASE-NOTES.txt file.

  * Added INSTALL file (executable file for generating catalog.xml)

  * Removed obsolete tools directory from package

Release 1.66.1

  * A number of important bug fixes.

  * Now xml:base attributes that are generated by an XInclude processor are
    resolved for image files.

  * Rewrote olink templates to support several new features.

      o Extended full olink support to FO output.

      o Add support for xrefstyle attribute in olinks.

      o New parameters to support new olink features: insert.olink.page.number
        , insert.olink.pdf.frag, olink.debug, olink.lang.fallback.sequence,
        olink.properties, prefer.internal.olink. See the reference page for
        each parameter for more information.

  * Added index.on.type parameter for new type attribute introduced in DocBook
    4.3 for indexterms and index. This allows you to create multiple indices
    containing different categories of entries. For users of 4.2 and earlier,
    you can use the new parameter index.on.role instead.

  * Added new section.autolabel.max.depth parameter to turn off section
    numbering below a certain depth. This permits you to number major section
    levels and leave minor section levels unnumbered.

  * Added footnote.sep.leader.properties attribute set to format the line
    separating footnotes in printed output.

  * Added parameter img.src.path as a prefix to HTML img src attributes. The
    prefix is added to whatever path is already generated by the stylesheet
    for each image file.

  * Added new attribute-sets informalequation.properties,
    informalexample.properties, informalfigure.properties, and
    informaltable.properties, so each such element type can be formatted
    individually if needed.

  * Add component.label.includes.part.label parameter to add any part number
    to chapter, appendix and other component labels when the label.from.part
    parameter is nonzero. This permits you to distinguish multiple chapters
    with the same chapter number in cross references and the TOC.

  * Added chunk.separate.lots parameter for HTML output. This parameter lets
    you generate separate chunk files for each LOT (list of tables, list of
    figures, etc.).

  * Added several table features:

      o Added table.table.properties attribute set to add properties to the
        fo:table element.

      o Added placeholder templates named table.cell.properties and
        table.cell.block.properties to enable adding properties to any
        fo:table-cell or the cell's fo:block, respectively. These templates
        are a start for implementing table styles.

  * Added new attribute set component.title.properties for easy modifications
    of component's title formatting in FO output.

  * Added Saxon support for an encoding attribute on the textdata element.
    Added new parameter textdata.default.encoding which specifies encoding
    when encoding attribute on textdata is missing.

  * Template label.this.section now controls whole section label, not only
    sub-label which corresponds to particular label. Former behaviour was IMHO
    bug as it was not usable.

  * Formatting in titleabbrev for TOC and headers is preserved when there are
    no hotlink elements in the title. Formerly the title showed only the text
    of the title, no font changes or other markup.

  * Added intial.page.number template to set the initial-page-number property
    for page sequences in print output. Customizing this template lets you
    change when page numbering restarts. This is similar to the
    format.page.number template that lets you change how the page number
    formatting changes in the output.

  * Added force.page.count template to set the force-page-count property for
    page sequences in print output. This is similar to the format.page.number
    template.

  * Sort language for localized index sorting in autoidx-ng.xsl is now taken
    from document lang, not from system environment.

  * Numbering and formatting of normal and ulink footnotes (if turned on) has
    been unified. Now ulink footnotes are mixed in with any other footnotes.

  * Added support for renderas attribute in section and sect1 et al. This
    permits you to render a given section title as if it were a different
    level.

  * Added support for label attribute in footnote to manually supply the
    footnote mark.

  * Added support for DocBook 4.3 corpcredit element.

  * Added support for a dbfo keep-together PI for formal objects (table,
    figure, example, equation, programlisting). That permits a formal object
    to be kept together if it is not already, or to be broken if it is very
    long and the default keep-together is not appropriate.

  * For graphics files, made file extension matching case insensitive, and
    updated the list of graphics extensions.

  * Allow calloutlist to have block content before the first callout

  * Added dbfo-need processing instruction to provide soft page breaks.

  * Added implementation of existing but unused default.image.width parameter
    for graphics.

  * Support DocBook NG tag inline element.

  * It appears that XEP now supports Unicode characters in bookmarks. There is
    no further need to strip accents from characters.

  * Make segmentedlist HTML markup more semantic and available to CSS styles.

  * Added user.preroot placeholder template to permit xsl-stylesheet and other
    PIs and comments to be output before the HTML root element.

  * Non-chunked legalnotice now gets an <a name="id"> element in HTML output
    so it can be referenced with xref or link.

  * In chunked HTML output, changed link rel="home" to rel="start", and link
    rel="previous" to rel="prev", per W3C HTML 4.01 spec.

  * Added several patches to htmlhelp from W. Borgert

  * Added Bosnian locale file as common/bs.xml.

Release 1.65.0

  * A number of important bug fixes.

  * Added a workaround to allow these stylesheets to process DocBook NG
    documents. (Its a hack that pre-processes the document to strip off the
    namespace and then uses exsl:node-set to process the result.)

  * Added alternative indexing mechanism which has better internationalization
    support. New indexing method allows grouping of accented letters like e,
    ,  into the same group under letter "e". It can also treat special
    letters (e.g. "ch") as one character and place them in the correct
    position (e.g. between "h" and "i" in Czech language).

    In order to use this mechanism you must create customization layer which
    imports some base stylesheet (like fo/docbook.xsl, html/chunk.xsl) and
    then includes appropriate stylesheet with new indexing code
    (fo/autoidx-ng.xsl or html/autoidx-ng.xsl). For example:

    <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                    version="1.0">

    <xsl:import href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/fo/docbook.xsl"/>
    <xsl:include href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/fo/autoidx-ng.xsl"/>

    </xsl:stylesheet>

    New method is known to work with Saxon and it should also work with
    xsltproc 1.1.1 and later. Currently supported languages are English,
    Czech, German, French, Spanish and Danish.

Release 1.64.1

General bug fixes and improvements. Sorry about the failure to produce an
updated release notes file for 1.62.01.63.2

  * In the course of fixing bug #849787, wrapping Unicode callouts with an
    appropriate font change in the Xalan extensions, I discovered that the
    Xalan APIs have changed a bit. So xalan2.jar will work with older Xalan 2
    implementations, xalan25.jar works with Xalan 2.5.

Release 1.61.0

Lots of bug fixes and improvements.

  * Initial support for timestamp PI. From now you can use <?dbtimestamp
    format="Y-m-d H:M:S"?> to get current datetime in your document. Added
    localization support for datetime PI

  * Added level 6 to test for section depth in section.level template so that
    section.title.level6.properties will be used for sections that are 6 deep
    or deeper. This should also cause a h6 to be created in html output.

  * Don't use SVG graphics if use.svg=0

  * Now uses number-and-title-template for sections only if section.autolabel
    is not zero.

  * Added missing 'english-language-name' attribute to the l10n element, and
    the missing 'style' attribute to the template element so the current
    gentext documents will validate.

  * Corrected several references to parameter qanda.defaultlabel that were
    missing the "$".

  * Now accepts admon.textlabel parameter to turn off Note, Warning, etc.
    label.

  * FeatReq #684561: support more XEP metadata

  * Added hyphenation support. Added support for coref. Added beginpage
    support. (does nothing; see TDG).

  * Added support for hyphenation-character, hyphenation-push-character-count,
    and hyphenation-remain-character-count

  * Added root.properties, ebnf.assignment, and ebnf.statement.terminator

  * Support bgcolor PI in table cells; make sure rowsep and colsep don't have
    any effect on the last row or column

  * Handle othercredit on titlepage a little better

  * Applied fix from Jeff Beal that fixed the bug that put secondary page
    numbers on primary entries. Same with tertiary page numbers on secondary
    entries.

  * Added definition of missing variable collection.

  * Make footnote formatting 'normal' even when it occurs in a context that
    has special formatting

  * Added warning when glossary.collection is not blank, but it cannot open
    the specified file.

  * Pick up the frame attribute on table and informaltable.

  * indexdiv/title in non-autogenerated indexes are now picked up.

  * Removed (unused) component.title.properties

  * Move IDs from page-sequences down to titlepage blocks

  * Use proportional-column-width(1) on more tables.

    Use proportional-column-width() for header/footer tables; suppress
    relative-align when when using FOP

  * Check for glossterm.auto.link when linking firstterms; don't output gl.
    prefix on glossterm links

  * Generate Part ToCs

  * Support glossary, bibliography, and index in component ToCs.

  * Refactored chunking code so that customization of chunk algorithm and
    chunk elements is more practical

  * Support textobject/phrase on inlinemediaobject.

  * Support 'start' PI on ordered lists

  * Fixed test of $toc PI to turn on qandaset TOC.

  * Added process.chunk.footnotes to sect2 through 5 to fix bug of missing
    footnotes when chunk level greater than 1.

  * Added paramater toc.max.depth which controls maximal depth of ToC as
    requested by PHP-DOC group.

  * Exempted titleabbrev from preamble processing in lists, and fixed
    variablelist preamble code to use the same syntax as the other lists.

  * Added support for elements between variablelist and first varlistentry
    since DocBook 4.2 supports that now.

Release 1.60.1

Lots of bug fixes.

  * The format of the titlepage.templates.xml files and the stylesheet that
    transforms them have been significantly changed. All of the attributes
    used to control the templates are now namespace qualified. So what used to
    be:

    <t:titlepage element="article" wrapper="fo:block">

    is now:

    <t:titlepage t:element="article" t:wrapper="fo:block">

    Attributes from other namespaces (including those that are unqualified)
    are now copied directly through. In practice, this means that the names
    that used to be fo: qualified:

    <title named-template="component.title"
           param:node="ancestor-or-self::article[1]"
           fo:text-align="center"
           fo:keep-with-next="always"
           fo:font-size="&hsize5;"
           fo:font-weight="bold"
           fo:font-family="{$title.font.family}"/>

    are now unqualified:

    <title t:named-template="component.title"
           param:node="ancestor-or-self::article[1]"
           text-align="center"
           keep-with-next="always"
           font-size="&hsize5;"
           font-weight="bold"
           font-family="{$title.font.family}"/>

    The t:titlepage and t:titlepage-content elements both generate wrappers
    now. And unqualified attributes on those elements are passed through. This
    means that you can now make the title font apply to ane entire titlepage
    and make the entire recto titlepage centered by specifying the font and
    alignment on the those elements:

    <t:titlepage t:element="article" t:wrapper="fo:block"
                 font-family="{$title.font.family}">

      <t:titlepage-content t:side="recto"
                 text-align="center">

  * Support use of titleabbrev in running headers and footers.

  * Added (experimental) xref.with.number.and.title parameter to enable
    number/title cross references even when the default would be just the
    number.

  * Generate part ToCs if they're requested.

  * Use proportional-column-width() in header/footer tables.

  * Handle alignment correctly when screenshot wraps a graphic in a figure.

  * Format chapter and appendix cross references consistently.

  * Attempt to support tables with multiple tgroups in FO.

  * Output fo:table-columns in simplelist tables.

  * Use titlepage.templates.xml for indexdiv and glossdiv formatting.

  * Improve support for new bibliography elements.

  * Added footnote.number.format, table.footnote.number.format,
    footnote.number.symbols, and table.footnote.number.symbols for better
    control of footnote markers.

  * Added glossentry.show.acronyms.

  * Suppress the draft-mode page masters when draft-mode is no.

  * Make blank pages verso not recto. D'Oh!

  * Improved formatting of ulink footnotes.

  * Fixed bugs in graphic width/height calculations.

  * Added class attributes to inline elements.

  * Don't add .html to the filenames identified with the dbhtml PI.

  * Don't force a ToC when sections contain refentrys.

  * Make section title sizes a function of the body.master.size.

Release 1.59.2

The 1.59.2 fixes an FO bug in the page masters that causes FOP to fail.

  * Removed the region-name from the region-body of blank pages. There's no
    reason to give the body of blank pages a unique name and doing so causes a
    mismatch that FOP detects.

  * Output IDs for the first paragraphs in listitems.

  * Fixed some small bugs in the handling of page numbers in double-sided
    mode.

  * Attempt to prevent duplicated IDs from being produced when endterm on xref
    points to something with nested structure.

  * Fix aligment problems in equations.

  * Output the type attribute on unordered lists (UL) in HTML only if the
    css.decoration parameter is true.

  * Calculate the font size in formal.title.properties so that it's 1.2 times
    the base font size, not a fixed "12pt".

Release 1.59.1

The 1.59.1 fixes a few bugs.

  * Added Bulgarian localization.

  * Indexing improvements; localize book indexes to books but allow setindex
    to index an entire set.

  * The default value for rowsep and colsep is now "1" as per CALS.

  * Added support for titleabbrev (use them for cross references).

  * Improvements to mediaobject for selecting print vs. online images.

  * Added seperate property sets for figures, examples, equations, tabless,
    and procedures.

  * Make lineannotations italic.

  * Support xrefstyle attribute.

  * Make endterm on xref higher priority than xreflabel target.

  * Glossary formatting improvements.

Release 1.58.0

The 1.58.0 adds some initial support for extensions in xsltproc, adds a few
features, and fixes bugs.

  * This release contains the first attempt at extension support for xsltproc.
    The only extension available to date is the one that adjusts table column
    widths. Run extensions/xsltproc/python/xslt.py.

  * Fixed bugs in calculation of adjusted column widths to correct for
    rounding errors.

  * Support nested refsection elements correctly.

  * Reworked gentext.template to take context into consideration. The name of
    elements in localization files is now an xpath-like context list, not just
    a simple name.

  * Made some improvements to bibliography formatting.

  * Improved graphical formatting of admonitions.

  * Added support for entrytbl.

  * Support spanning index terms.

  * Support bibliosource.

Release 1.57.0

  * The 1.57.0 release wasn't documented here. Oops.

Release 1.56.0

The 1.56.0 release fixes bugs.

  * Reworked chunking. This will break all existing customizations layers that
    change the chunking algorithm. If you're customizing chunking, look at the
    new content parameter that's passed to process-chunk-element and
    friends.

  * Support continued and inherited numeration in orderedlist formatting for
    FOs.

  * Added Thai localization.

  * Tweaked stylesheet documentation stylesheets to link to TDG and the
    parameter references.

  * Allow title on tables of contents ("Table of Contents") to be optional.
    Added new keyword to generate.toc. Support tables of contents on sections.

  * Made separate parameters for table borders and table cell borders:
    table.frame.border.color, table.frame.border.style,
    table.frame.border.thickness, table.cell.border.color,
    table.cell.border.style, and table.cell.border.thickness.

  * Suppress formatting of endofrange indexterms. This is only half-right.
    They should generate a range, but I haven't figured out how to do that
    yet.

  * Support revdescription. (Bug #582192)

  * Added default.float.class and fixed figure floats. (Bug #497603)

  * Fixed formatting of sbr in FOs.

  * Added context to the missing template error message.

  * Process arg correctly in a group. (Bug #605150)

  * Removed 'keep-with-next' from formal.title.properties attribute set now
    that the stylesheets support the option of putting such titles below the
    object. Now the $placement value determines if 'keep-with-next' or
    'keep-with-previous' is used in the title block.

  * Wrap url() around external-destinations when appropriate.

  * Fixed typo in compact list spacing. (Bug #615464)

  * Removed spurious hash in anchor name. (Bug #617717)

  * Address is now displayed verbatim on title pages. (Bug #618600)

  * The bridgehead.in.toc parameter is now properly supported.

  * Improved effectiveness of HTML cleanup by increasing the number of places
    where it is used. Improve use of HTML cleanup in XHTML stylesheets.

  * Support table of contents for appendix in article. (Bug #596599)

  * Don't duplicate footnotes in bibliographys and glossarys. (Bug #583282)

  * Added default.image.width. (Bug #516859)

  * Totally reworked funcsynopsis code; it now supports a 'tabular'
    presentation style for 'wide' prototypes; see
    funcsynopsis.tabular.threshold. (HTML only right now, I think, FO support,
    uh, real soon now.)

  * Reworked support for difference marking; toned down the colors a bit and
    added a system.head.content template so that the diff CSS wasn't
    overriding user.head.content. (Bug #610660)

  * Added call to the *.head.content elements when writing out long
    description chunks.

  * Make sure legalnotice link is correct even when chunking to a different
    base.dir.

  * Use CSS to set viewport characteristics if css.decoration is non-zero, use
    div instead of p for making graphic a block element; make figure titles
    the default alt text for images in a figure.

  * Added space-after to list.block.spacing.

  * Reworked section.level template to give correct answer instead of being
    off by one.

  * When processing tables, use the tabstyle attribute as the division class.

  * Fixed bug in html2xhtml.xsl that was causing the XHTML chunker to output
    HTML instead of XHTML.
