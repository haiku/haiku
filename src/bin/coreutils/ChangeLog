	version 8.4
	* NEWS: Record release date.

2010-01-13  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	tests: avoid spurious failures on older shells
	* tests/tail-2/inotify-hash-abuse: Use kill rather than wait
	to determine if the tail process is still running.
	* tests/tail-2/inotify-hash-abuse2: Ditto.

	tests: work around spurious test failure with OpenBSD4.5's /bin/sh
	* tests/ls/infloop: OpenBSD4.5's /bin/sh would mistakenly include
	"set -x"-output in an application's stderr stream when stderr is
	redirected before stdout.  This was causing one spurious test failure.
	The work-around: redirect stdout first.
	Reported by Nelson Beebe.

	tests: don't silently skip the sort-version tests
	* tests/misc/sort-version: Don't use <<- and indented here-doc contents.
	s/<<-/<</ and unindent the here-document contents.  Otherwise,
	bash would ignore the indented delimiter and use EOF, thus silently
	skipping this test.  OpenBSD5.4's shell reported the failure:
	  $ printf 'cat<<-x\n foo\n x\n'|sh
	  sh: <stdin>[4]: here document `x' unclosed
	  [Exit 1]
	by contrast, bash warns but still exits successfully:
	  $ printf 'cat<<-x\n foo\n x\n'|bash && echo you lose
	  bash: line 3: warning: here-document at line 1 delimited by \
	    end-of-file (wanted `x')
	   foo
	   x
	  you lose

	tests: avoid spurious failure on old kernel
	* tests/touch/no-dereference: Skip test if utimensat doesn't
	support symlinks.
	Reported by Bernhard Voelker.

2010-01-12  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	maint: update info about getting the prerequisite automake
	* README-prereq: Now that we require automake-1.11.1
	update the instructions from getting it from the git repo

	maint: remove an already handled item from TODO
	* TODO: The question regarding printf octal escapes is answered in
	commit 4bcefa62, 2003-04-21, "Fix printf POSIX compatibility bug ..."

	maint: fix tests on solaris by using /usr/xpg4/bin
	* tests/check.mk: Prepend /usr/xpg4/bin to the $PATH if present.
	Using the more standard utilities allows tests such as misc/printenv,
	which uses the -E option to grep, to complete.

2010-01-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib, to get fixed getlogin-related tests

	build: fix build failure due to missing libxattr
	Configure is supposed to detect insufficient XATTR support.
	However, if a system has the required headers, but no library,
	the configure script would mistakenly enable USE_XATTR.
	* m4/xattr.m4 (gl_FUNC_XATTR): If the attr_copy_file function
	is not found, don't set USE_XATTR.
	Nelson Beebe reported a link failure on RHEL 5.3.
	Also, do not let the combination of --disable-xattr and
	a stray LIB_XATTR environment setting perturb the build.
	* NEWS (Build-related): Mention it.

	doc: mention the wchar.h vs. glibc build problem
	* NEWS (Build-related): Mention the wchar.h issue.

	* src/ls.c: Include <sys/capability.h> later, to avoid build
	failure with a header from libcap-2.16-1 or earlier.
	See http://bugzilla.redhat.com/483548 for details.

2010-01-07  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	pr: ensure the page header line is of the required format
	Before this change, with too long a file name, the name would
	abut the date field on the left and possibly also the "Page N"
	field on the right, rather than leaving a one-space separator
	in each case.  Fixes a regression introduced on Mar 6 2009,
	by commit a4053c5291d5797734b3e4f042f9e1adf3944fd6

	* src/pr.c (print_header): Ensure that there is at least one

	build: require newer versions of automake and autoconf
	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.62 and automake-1.11.1 or newer.
	* bootstrap.conf (buildreq): Require automake-1.11.1 or newer,
	to ensure people use a version with the fix for CVE-2009-4029.

	* src/tac.c (main): Free the input buffer in most cases.

2010-01-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: use more readable operator: "||" rather than "|"
	* src/cp.c (make_dir_parents_private): Use "||" rather than "|",

	to ease formatting of translations.  The latter was prompted by
	a report from Stéphane Raimbault.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tail invocation): Update description here, too.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	doc: mention two tail -F bug fixes in NEWS
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Two tail -F fixes.

	tail: test for a bug in inotify-enabled tail -F
	tail -F a b would stop tracking additions to b after "mv a b".
	* tests/tail-2/F-vs-rename: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2009-12-30  Giuseppe Scrivano  <gscrivano@gnu.org>

	tail -F: don't stop following the target of a rename
	This fixes a bug whereby tail -F would fail to track changes
	to a file that was a target of a rename, and when the source of
	the rename was another tailed file.

	* src/tail.c (tail_forever_inotify): Ensure the wd is not already
	present in the hash table before trying to add it.  When a new watch
	descriptor is added to the `wd_to_name' hash table, check that it is
	not already present.  If it is present then remove the previous element.

2009-12-30  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	maint: improve the info about $PATH in README-prereq
	* README-prereq: It wasn't obvious that the $PATH should
	be set before building any of the prerequisite packages,
	so move that information up.

2009-12-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tail: add another test to exercise abort-inducing flaw in tail -F
	* tests/tail-2/inotify-hash-abuse2: New test, based on a reproducer
	by Rob Wortman.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	tail: add a test to exercise abort-inducing flaw in tail -F
	* tests/tail-2/inotify-hash-abuse: New file, derived from
	a report by Rob Wortman.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Improved by: Pádraig Brady.

2009-12-29  Giuseppe Scrivano  <gscrivano@gnu.org>

	tail: remove `fdspec' from the hash table before changing its key
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever_inotify): Avoid modifying fdspec->wd while
	it is in the wd_to_name hash table.  Once it is removed, it can be
	added using the new `wd' as key for the hash table.  This fixes the
	abort-inducing bug reported by Rob Wortman in
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/19372

2009-12-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: quiet "make" in doc/
	* doc/Makefile.am (constants.texi): Add a use of AM_V_GEN.

	tail: rename an internal variable
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever_inotify): s/wd_table/wd_to_name/

	tail: avoid read-beyond-end-of-buffer error
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever_inotify): Do not use f[i] in a context
	where i may be larger than the largest valid index.  In the final
	"if" clause in which we'd remove an inotify watch, we might have
	used f[n_files].  Use fspec instead, since it is guaranteed to
	be defined.

2009-12-26  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	maint: ignore more built files
	Recent gnulib changes added new built files.

	* .gitignore: Add arg-nonnull.h, link-warning.h,
	unused-parameter.h.

	tac: supply link dependency
	* src/Makefile.am (tac_LDADD): Add LIB_GETHRXTIME.
	* THANKS: Update.

	tail: shrink internal struct by 8 bytes
	* tail.c (struct File_spec): Rearrange struct members to decrease
	size by 8 bytes to 76,96 on i686,x86_64 respectively.

2009-12-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: tail: avoid in-function #if directives
	* src/tail.c (fremote): Add a comment.
	Move definition "up" to precede first use, so we can
	remove its prototype and the #if..#endif around each use.
	(any_remote_file): Rename from any_remote_files.

2009-12-25  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	tail: fix --follow to not use inotify on remote files
	* src/tail.c (struct File_spec): Add a flag to record if file is remote.

	(tailable_stdin): A new function to refactor the check for whether
	a tailable file was specified through stdin.
	(fremote): A new function to check if a file descriptor
	refers to a remote file.
	(tail_forever_inotify): Add some comments.
	(tail_file): Record if a file is remote when initially opened.
	(main): Disable inotify if any remote files specified.
	Also document the caveat about remounted files not
	being noticed by inotify.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

2009-12-23  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	wc: line-buffer the printed counts
	* src/wc.c (main): Set stdout to line buffered mode
	to ensure parallel running instances don't intersperse
	their output.  This adds 6.5% to the run time in the worst case
	of many zero length files, but has neglible impact for
	standard sized files.
	* tests/misc/wc-parallel: New test for atomic output.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Reference it.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix
	This is similar to commit 710fe413, 20-10-2009,
	"md5sum, sha*sum, sum: line-buffer the printed checksums"

2009-12-22  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	stat: Recognize k-afs, gfs, ocfs2 file system types
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Add k-afs, gfs/gfs2 and ocfs2.
	* NEWS: Update the stat -f entry.

	stat: add support for more file system types
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype): Add the following FS types:
	fuseblk, rpc_pipefs.  Also fix a typo of minux3 to minix3,
	and mention the fs-magic-compare make target to help update the list.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

2009-12-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: correct coreutils-specific distcheck rules
	* dist-check.mk (built_programs): Use $(bin_PROGRAMS), not $(PROGRAMS).
	Otherwise, my-instcheck would fail due to non-installation of e.g.,
	the noinst_PROGRAMS, setuidgid and getlimits.
	(taint-distcheck): Correct the grep command that checks for libtool
	traces in configure.

2009-12-20  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	touch: fix ctime regression in 'touch -a'
	Regression introduced in coreutils 8.1 due to a bug in the Linux
	kernel implementation of utimensat with mtime of UTIME_OMIT.

	* gnulib: Update to latest, to pick up utimensat fix.
	* NEWS: Mention the change.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Reported by John Stanley.

2009-12-19  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	maint: don't include the strverscmp gnulib module
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove the strverscmp module
	which is not used since commit e505736f, on 03-10-2008,
	"ls and sort: use filevercmp instead of strverscmp"

	doc: enhance and reference info about version comparison
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Reference the additional
	info about filevercmp rather than the unused strverscmp.
	(Details about version sort): Add some examples that are not
	handled well by fileversmp.
	* src/ls.c: Change a comment referencing the now unused strverscmp.

	rm: fix --one-file-system regression due to fts conversion
	* src/remove.c (rm_fts): Fix incorrect comparison of
	device and inode numbers.
	* tests/rm/one-file-system2: Add a separate test so
	that it can be run as a normal user (It doesn't need to mount).
	* tests/Makefile.am: Reference it.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.
	Reported by Jan Larres.

2009-12-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: improve dist-check.mk rules
	* dist-check.mk (null_AM_MAKEFLAGS): Remove LIBTOOL.  Adding it was
	erroneous, since it is required when building from a distribution
	tarball of a libtool-using project.  Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.
	(my-distcheck): Reorganize to use a subshell and set -e, so that
	failures propagate "out".  Without this change, setting LIBTOOL=false
	would cause a failure that would then be ignored, probably due to a
	problem in $(install-transform-check).

2009-12-14  Thiago Farina  <tfransosi@gmail.com>

	base64: use *_OPTION_DESCRIPTION macros instead of hard-coded strings
	* src/base64 (usage): Use HELP_OPTION_DESCRIPTION and
	VERSION_OPTION_DESCRIPTION macros, not literal strings.

2009-12-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: unpack xz-compressed tarballs when possible, not always *.gz
	* dist-check.mk: Unpack compressed tarball using xz when possible,
	since that's faster.

	maint: make dist-check.mk more easily shared
	* dist-check.mk (built_programs): More generic, but still assumes src/.
	Don't set GZIP in environment when untarring.
	(my-distcheck): Use $(DIST_ARCHIVES), rather than assuming that
	there is always a .tar.gz file.

	nohup: if fd_repoen fails (redirecting stdin), report it
	* src/nohup.c (main): Don't ignore fd_reopen failure.

	tests: make the taint-distcheck rule easier to share with other projects
	* dist-check.mk (taint-distcheck): Skip this test in a project
	that uses libtool.

	stat: recognize "sockfs" file system type, ...
	... now that its magic number appears in <linux/magic.h>.
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype) [S_MAGIC_SOCKFS]: Add case.

	maint: move definitions from maint.mk to dist-check.mk
	* dist-check.mk (null_AM_MAKEFLAGS): Define here, not in maint.mk.
	(built_programs): Likewise.
	(my-distcheck): Move comments to...
	(coreutils-path-check): ...the code they refer to.
	Remove obsolete comments.
	(null_AM_MAKEFLAGS): Add gperf, even though it's not used here.
	* gnulib: Update to latest, for fixed maint.mk.

	tests: use a slightly better CU_TEST_NAME setting
	* tests/check.mk (CU_TEST_NAME): Better test names.

	tail: don't call fstat on an uninitialized FD
	This bug showed up via valgrind as a "Conditional jump or move
	depends on uninitialized value(s)" error.
	* src/tail.c (ignore_fifo_and_pipe): New function.
	(main): Use it only when tailing forever.
	The code to compute n_viable and mark some F[i] as ignored would call
	isapipe on an uninitialized file descriptor.  But n_viable and those
	.ignored marks are useful/used only when tailing forever.  This bug
	was introduced via commit f0ff8c73 (7.6), "tail: make the new

	sort: fix failure if sort's parent has ignored SIGCHLD
	* src/sort.c (main): Reset the SIGCHLD handler to the default

	to SIG_IGN to ensure the sort command resets it to SIG_DFL.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

	timeout: fix failure if timeout's parent has ignored SIGCHLD
	* src/timeout.c (main): Reset the SIGCHLD handler to the default
	as otherwise wait() could return -1 and set errno to ECHILD.
	This condition was ignored until commit 0b1dcf33, on 31-08-2009,
	"timeout: defensive handling of all wait() errors"
	but subsequently timeout would run the command correctly
	but then fail with an error message.

	id: handle systems without getgroups support
	If getgroups failed with ENOSYS, mgetgroups would unnecessarily
	fail, and that provoked id into freeing an uninitialized pointer.
	Meanwhile, we were not using xalloc_die properly.  Both issues
	are better solved in gnulib, by introducing xgetgroups; this
	patch uses the new interface.

	Regression introduced by commit 6a31fd8d7.

	* gnulib: Update, for mgetgroups improvments.
	* src/id.c (print_full_info): Adjust caller to die on allocation
	failure, and no longer worry about ENOSYS.

	tests: fix link failure on cygwin
	Counterpart to commit 8fe40b84bd8, since test-link.c uses rename,
	and we override gnulib with a rename() replacement that can xalloc_die.

	* gl/modules/link-tests.diff: New file.

	build: fix link failure on cygwin
	Cygwin 1.5 has a broken sleep, and the gnulib tests dragged in
	rpl_sleep which then caused a link failure because it wasn't in
	libcoreutils.a.  We could solve it by using the gnulib sleep module.
	However, sleep and usleep may interact poorly with SIGALRM, and they
	have less granularity; so it is better to adopt a policy that if we
	must sleep, prefer xnanosleep.

	* src/sort.c (pipe_fork): Use xnanosleep, to avoid the need for
	rpl_sleep on cygwin, and to reduce granularity.
	(MAX_FORK_TRIES_COMPRESS, MAX_FORK_TRIES_DECOMPRESS): Increase,
	to account for reduction in granularity.
	* src/tail.c (tail_file): Use xnanosleep in debug code.

	These tests perform no PATH search, and used to simply delete PATH from

	where cygwin.dll must be resolvable via PATH when starting a sub-shell.
	With commit 0cc04241, we took the alternate approach of untainting the
	incoming $ENV{PATH}, but that fails when it contains an other-writable
	directory.  Instead, now we hard code it to '/bin:/usr/bin'.

	true, false: perform initialization only when argc == 2
	* src/true.c (main): There is no reason to examine argv[0],

	This has the side effect of making it so that these programs
	no longer segfault when subjected to execve abuse.
	Before this change, these commands would make "true" segfault:
	  printf '%s\n' '#include <unistd.h>' 'int main(int c, char**v)' \

	ls: fix capability coloring
	Capability checking was incorrectly done on just the base name
	rather than on the whole path.  Consequently there could be both
	false positives and negatives when coloring files with capabilities.
	Also capability checking was not done at all in certain cases for
	non executable files.  Note passing absolute rather than relative
	names to cap_get_file() reduces the has_capability() overhead

	nice, nohup, su: detect write failure to stderr
	These programs can print non-fatal diagnostics to stderr prior to
	exec'ing a subsidiary program.  However, if we thought the situation
	warranted a diagnostic, we insist that the diagnostic be printed
	without error, rather than blindly exec, as it may be a security risk.

	For an example, try 'nice -n -1 nice 2>/dev/full'.  Failure to raise
	priority (by lowering niceness) is not fatal, but failure to inform
	the user about failure to change priority is dangerous.

	build: don't let environment settings perturb build
	Setting the envvars, LIB_FDATASYNC, LIB_XATTR or LIB_CRYPT
	could cause a configure-time and/or build-time malfunction.
	Typically, a configure-time function-in-library test is performed
	via code like this:

	  LIB_VAR=
	  AC_SUBST([LIB_VAR])
	  prefix_saved_LIBS=$LIBS
	    AC_SEARCH_LIBS([FUNC], [LIB_NAME],
	                   [test "$ac_cv_search_FUNC" = "none required" ||
	                    LIB_VAR=$ac_cv_search_FUNC])
	  LIBS=$prefix_saved_LIBS

	However, in each of the files affected by this change, the LIB_VAR=
	initialization was omitted.  Thus, when set in the environment, its
	value would propagate into generated Makefiles when FUNC is not found
	in LIB_NAME.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (coreutils_MACROS): Initialize AC_SUBST'd var
	* m4/lib-check.m4 (cu_LIB_CHECK): Likewise.

	chcon: exit immediately if SELinux is disabled
	This change happens to avoid an abort in chcon when SELinux is
	disabled while operating on a file with an "unlabeled" context from
	back in 2006.  However, that same abort can still be triggered by the
	same file when running chcon with SELinux enabled.  This bug in chcon
	will be fixed in a subsequent commit via a getfilecon wrapper.  See
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/18378/focus=18384
	for how to correct your disk attributes to avoid triggering this bug.

	tail: avoid a race where we could miss new data with --pid
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever, tail_forever_inotify): Close a race in
	tail_forever_inotify where new data written after the file check by
	a now dead process, but before the pid check, is not output.  We use
	the POSIX guarantee that read() and write() are serialized wrt each
	other even in separate processes, to assume full file consistency
	after exit() and so poll for new data _after_ the writer has exited.
	This also allows us to not redundantly _wait_ for new data if the
	process is dead.
	* tests/tail-2/pid: Remove the now partially invalid sub second sleep
	check as we now don't unconditionally wait, and replace it with a check
	for the redundant sleep.  Also clarify some of the existing comments.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

2009-09-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: tail-2/pid: use a 3-second timeout, not 1
	* tests/tail-2/pid: When using the timeout program to ensuring that
	tail -s.1 --pid=$PID_T_MAX does not wait forever, use a timeout longer
	than 1 second.  A 1-second timeout could be too short on a very busy
	system, and result in a timeout, and hence false-positive failure.

	Previously for `ls -Ls` (but not `ls -Lsl`), we referenced

	ls: print "?", not "0" as inode of dereferenced dangling symlink
	ls prints inode numbers two ways: for long (-l) listings,
	and for short ones, e.g., ls -li and ls -i.  The code to print
	long listings properly printed "?" when the inode was unknown,
	but the code for handling short listings would print 0 instead.
	Factor out the formatting code into a new function so ls prints
	the right string ("?") from both places:
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.
	* src/ls.c (format_inode): New function.
	(print_long_format): Use it here.
	(print_file_name_and_frills): Use it here, too.

	ls -i: print consistent inode numbers also for mount points
	On most unix- and linux-based kernels, ls -i DIR_CONTAINING_MOUNT_POINT
	would print the wrong inode number for any entry that is a mount point.
	It would do that by relying on readdir's dirent.d_ino values, while
	most readdir implementations return the inode number of the underlying,
	inaccessible directory.  Thus, it is not consistent with what you'd
	get when applying stat to the same entry.  This bug led to surprising
	results like "ls -i" and "ls -i --color" printing different numbers (ls
	must usually "stat" a file to colorize its name).  This change makes it
	so that on offending systems, ls must stat non-command-line-arguments
	for which otherwise it would be able to use "for free" dirent.d_ino
	values.  Regardless of this change, ls is already required to stat every
	command-line argument.  Note: versions of GNU ls prior to coreutils-6.0
	did not perform the invalid optimization, and hence always printed
	correct inode numbers.  Thus, for the sake of correctness, ls -i is
	forgoing the readdir optimization, for any kernel (including linux!)
	with POSIX-nonconforming readdir.  Note that currently, only Cygwin has
	been agile enough to conform.

	* src/ls.c (RELIABLE_D_INO): Define.
	(print_dir): Use it.
	For plenty of discussion, see this long thread:

	* tests/ls/readdir-mountpoint-inode: New test.

	* tests/ls/stat-vs-dirent: Don't suppress failure of this test,

	from which we'd set LD_PRELOAD contains unsafe characters.

	install: avoid a portability bug when compiling with non-gcc
	* src/install.c (extra_mode): Be careful to return only a 0 or 1
	value, since this is a "bool" function, and there are still some
	compilers for which this is necessary.  Without this change,

	compiler would produce a malfunctioning "install" binary.  Details in
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/17710/focus=17760

	tests: make install-C slightly less prone to confusion
	* tests/install/install-C: Invoke framework_failure, if necessary.

	build: avoid "make dist" failure in man/
	Now that "make check" no longer builds programs like arch, ...
	* src/Makefile.am (dist-hook): Depend on $(all_programs), so that the
	subsequent build in man/ doesn't fail due to lack of a program like
	arch that is not going to be installed.

	Reported by C de-Avillez.

	dd: fix a signal handling race
	* src/dd.c (main): Install the signal handlers at startup
	rather than just before the copy starts. In this way signals
	received before the copy (like during a slow truncate for e.g.)

	Note: each file already has a comment to that effect from help2man.
	* man/Makefile.am (.x.1): Make generated files read-only.
	Also, don't redirect directly to the target, $@.

	mv, rm: adapt to new and improved gnulib interfaces
	Use gnulib's new priv-set module and updated write-any-file.
	With them, the remove-called can_write_any_file function no
	longer tries to drop the unlink-directory privilege, so now
	each caller of remove must do that separately, calling
	priv_set_remove_linkdir.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add priv-set.
	* src/rm.c: Include "priv-set.h".

	that makes --version output print the UTF-8 rendering of author names

	so that a failing "make check" explains that Perl is not installed.
	Reported by James Youngman.

	build: doc: emit something for each "make check"-run rule
	* doc/Makefile.am: Use $(AM_V_GEN) in place of each leading "@".

	cp: work around linux kernel bug: short-read != EOF on /proc
	Remove the optimization that avoided up to 50% of cp's read syscalls.
	Do not assume that a short read on a regular file indicates EOF.
	When reading from a file in /proc on linux [at least 2.6.9 - 2.6.29]
	into a 4k-byte buffer or larger, a short read does not
	always indicate EOF.  For example, "cp /proc/slabinfo /tmp"
	copies only 4068 of the total 7493 bytes.  This optimization
	(25719a33154f0c62ea9881f0c79ae312dd4cec7a, Improve performance a bit
	by optimizing away; 2005-11-24) appears to have been worth less than
	a 2% speed-up (and usually much less), so the impact of removing it
	is negligible.

	* tests/cp/proc-short-read: New test, lightly based on a suggestion
	from Mike Frysinger, to exercise this fix.

	tests: avoid new "make distcheck" failure due to newer File::Temp
	With newer perl (e.g., Fedora 10's 4:5.10.0-68.fc10), tests/CuTmpdir.pm
	stopped removing its temporary directories, with diagnostics like this:
	  cannot remove path when cwd is /c/coreutils/tests/misc/seq.tmp-e2up \
	  for /c/coreutils/tests/misc/seq.tmp-e2up: at \
	  /usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/File/Temp.pm line 902
	Chdir out of the target directory before that code runs:
	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm (END): chdir '..'.
	(chmod_tree): Remove explicit "chdir $dir".

	ls: fix alignment when month names have varying widths
	Reported by Samuel Thibault and Stéphane Raimbault, as the glibc fr_FR
	locale has recently changed to use the official but variable width
	abbreviated month names. Other glibc locales also have variable widths.
	http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-locales/2008-q1/msg00035.html
	http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9859
	* NEWS: Mention the fix
	* gl/lib/mbsalign.c: A new module to align and truncate a
	string in a specified number of screen cells, while handling
	multi-byte characters appropriately.
	* gl/lib/mbsalign.h: Ditto
	* gl/modules/mbsalign: Ditto
	* bootstrap.conf: Reference the new module
	* src/ls.c (abmon_init): New function, precompute the abbreviated
	months aligned left in a minimum width column <= 5 screen cells.
	(align_nstrftime): New function, replace the first %b in the
	format specification to strftime with the precomputed month string.
	Note using the cached month strings speeds up `ls -lU` by around 17%
	on glibc-2.7-2 on linux at least.  Also if we implement this function
	using heap storage rather than automatic storage, and use snprintf
	instead of strcpy, ls will slow down by 2% and 1% respectively
	(i.e. a net gain of 14% rather than 17%).

	tests: add another sort/nmerge test
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sort-merge-fdlimit.
	* tests/misc/sort-merge-fdlimit: New file.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document that we now silently
	lower nmerge if necessary.
	Patch by Paul Eggert, Nima Nikzad, Max Chang, Alexander Nguyen,
	Sahil Amoli, and Nick Graham.

	sort: handle fd exhaustion better when merging
	This is an alternative to my 9 March patch labeled "Silently lower
	nmerge; don't (sometimes incorrectly) range-check"
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-03/msg00070.html>.
	It differs by not using 'dup' to probe for extra file descriptors;
	instead, it simply calls 'open' (and 'pipe') to open files and pipes,
	until one of these calls fails due to file descriptor exhaustion; it
	then backs off by 1, does a merge with the files that it has opened,
	and then retries with the (now-smaller) number of files.

	This patch requires quite a few more changes to the source code than
	the earlier patch, but it is in some sense "better" because it doesn't
	need to call "dup" ahead of time in order to decide whether "open" or
	"pipe" will fail.  Also, it's more robust in the case where "open" or
	"pipe" fails with errno==EMFILE because some system-wide limit is
	exhausted.

	* src/sort.c (create_temp_file): New arg SURVIVE_FD_EXHAUSTION.
	(stream_open): New function, containing guts of xfopen.
	(xfopen): Use it.
	(pipe_fork): Set errno on failure.
	(maybe_create_temp): New function, containing guts of create_temp.
	(create_temp): Use it.
	(open_temp): Distinguish failures due to file descriptor exhaustion
	from other failures, and on fd exhaustion return a notice to caller
	rather than dying.  Don't test execlp's return value; when it returns,
	it *always* returns -1.
	(open_input_files): New function.
	(mergefps): New arg FPS. It's now the caller's responsibility to open
	the input and output files.  All callers changed.
	(mergefiles): New function.
	(avoid_trashing_input, merge): Handle the case where a single merge
	can't merge as much as we wanted due to file descriptor exhaustion, by
	merging as much as we can and then retrying.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add misc/sort-continue.
	* tests/misc/sort-continue: New file.

	* HACKING: avoid trailing white space

	cp: diagnose invalid "cp -rl dir dir" right away, once again
	Running "mkdir dir; cp -rl dir dir" would create dir/dir/dir/...
	rather than diagnosing the "copy-into-self" failure.

	The easy fix would have been to revert this part of the change
	[3ece0355 2008-11-09 cp: use far less memory in some cases]
	that introduced the bug:

	-         remember_copied (dst_name, dst_sb.st_ino, dst_sb.st_dev);
	+         if (!x->hard_link)
	+           remember_copied (dst_name, dst_sb.st_ino, dst_sb.st_dev);

	However, that would have induced the failure of the new cp/link-heap
	test, due to the added memory pressure of recording 10k dev/ino pairs.
	And besides, I liked that improvement and wanted to keep it.

	Now that it's obvious recording the just-created-directory dev/ino
	needn't depend on the setting of hard_link, I realized it is necessary
	to record the pair only for the first directory created for each
	source command-line argument.

	I made that change, then noticed the new test, cp -rl a d d, would pass
	when run once, yet output the into-self diagnostic twice.  Also note
	the side effect: it creates d/a and d/d.  However, running that same
	command a second time, now with the modified directory, would fail.

	That turned out to be due to the fact that although the first into-self
	failure was detected in copy_dir, that function would continue copying
	other entries regardless -- and that would make it fail (eventually)
	with the unwanted recursion.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): This function needed an indicator of
	whether, for a give command line argument, it had already created its
	first directory.  If so, no more need to record dev/ino pairs.  If this
	is the first, then do record its pair.  Hence, the new parameter.
	(copy_dir, copy): Update callers.
	(copy_dir): Upon any into-self failure, break out of the loop.
	* tests/cp/into-self: Test for the above.

	a highlighted name being printed initially in the last row of a
	terminal emulator (possibly followed by other lines of output) such
	that it is wrapped onto the following line, as the terminal emulator
	scrolls the output.  That would cause the entire following line to
	be highlighted, even if the name happened to use only one position.
	The least-invasive patch would have made colorized output larger for
	all uses.  The approach taken below is more invasive, but limits the
	increase in overhead to only those lines that are expected to wrap.
	* src/ls.c (enum indicator_no): Add C_CLR_TO_EOL.
	(indicator_name): Add "cl".
	(color_indicator): Add default escape codes for "cl".
	(print_long_format): Propagate width to print_name_with_quoting.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Print new C_CLR_TO_EOL string if needed.
	Return the width of what we're printing.
	(print_file_name_and_frills): Propagate width.
	(print_type_indicator): Return bool (aka width).
	(print_many_per_line): Pass column position to print_* function.
	(print_current_files): Likewise.
	(print_horizontal): Likewise.
	(print_with_commas): Likewise.
	* src/dircolors.c (slack_codes): Add "CLRTOEOL".
	(ls_codes): Add "cl".
	* tests/ls/color-clear-to-eol: New file.  Test for this fix.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add ls/color-clear-to-eol.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Reported by Alexander V. Lukyanov.  See thread for details:
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/740021/focus=14824
	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt for helping me reproduce the problem.

	Demonstrate with this in an 80-column xterm:
	  seq 200 # to start in the "bottom" row
	  touch zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.foo
	  env LS_COLORS='*.foo=0;31;42' ls -og --color=always

	Before the fix, you'd see something like this:
	(where the file name is printed in red on a green background,
	and each "=" denotes a space on a green background)
	...
	  -rw-r--r--  1       0 Feb  5 11:31 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\
	  zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.foo===================================================

	After the patch, the trailing green spaces are gone:

	  -rw-r--r--  1       0 Feb  5 11:31 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\
	  zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.foo

	* src/timeout.c (apply_time_suffix): Change input parameter from
	unsigned int to unsigned long, which is the type of the variable it's
	actually manipulating.  This removes the need for the cast which was
	giving a warning with the gcc options: -fstrict-aliasing
	-Wstrict-aliasing.  Also add a check for overflow possible on 16-bit
	platforms, and fix indents.
	(main): Remove a redundant cast in the alarm() call.

	wc: read and process --files0-from= input a name at a time,

	* src/Makefile.am: Add getlimits to list of utilities
	to build but not install. Also add it to the list linked
	with libiconv
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add getlimits to translation list.

	dd: avoid unnecessary memory copies
	* src/dd.c (scanargs): When not otherwise required (e.g. for
	conversion), use two-buffer mode only when the input and output
	buffer sizes differ.  Before, some of the most basic invocations of
	dd, e.g., dd < in > out, would unnecessarily use separate buffers
	and perform memory copies between them.

2008-11-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	cp: use far less memory in some cases
	cp --link was "remembering" many name,dev,inode triples unnecessarily.
	cp was doing the same, even without --link, for every directory in the
	source hierarchy, while it can do its job with entries merely for the
	command-line arguments.  Prompted by a report from Patrick Shoenfeld.
	Details <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/15081>.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Refrain from remembering
	name,dev,inode for most files, when invoked via cp --link.
	Record an infloop-avoidance triple for each directory specified
	on the command line, not for each directory in the source tree.
	Don't record a dir-triple when x->hard_link is set.

	factor: remove --bignum and --no-bignum options
	Here's a patch to remove the --bignum and --no-bignum options from
	'factor'.  The case for removing --bignum isn't as strong as that for

	complicate the documentation unnecessarily.

	v6.10-185-g4827dd2, which broke 'seq' on the x86; for example, it
	causes "seq 9223372036854775807 9223372036854775808" to incorrectly
	output 3 numbers instead of 2.  It's better to punish obsolescent
	hosts that have incorrectly-working floating-point than to punish
	correctly-working hosts.
	* tests/misc/seq: Use 0.9000000000000, rather than
	0.90000000000000000000, to avoid tickling a bug in Solaris 8 strtold,
	which converts "0.9" and "0.9000000000000" correctly, but incorrectly
	converts "0.90000000000000000000" to a smaller value.

2008-10-24  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	group-list: avoid compiler warning
	* src/group-list.c (print_group_list) [!HAVE_GETGROUPS]: Always
	return value.

2008-10-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	ls: use '.' (not +) as SELinux-only alt. access flag in ls -l output
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file) [long_format]: Map SELinux-only to '.',
	any other nonempty combination of MAC and ACL to '+', and all else
	to the usual ' '.  Suggested by Michael Stone.
	* tests/misc/selinux: Adapt: expect '.', not '+'.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (What information is listed): Document this.
	* NEWS (Changes in behavior): Mention it.

2008-10-22  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	Remove lzma as a specific build requirement
	* bootstrap.conf: lzma was added as a build requirement
	in the recently added build tools requirements check.
	Remove that as it's quite new and also only required
	for the make dist stage.

2008-10-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Describe exit statuses more concisely.

2008-10-22  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	Add better checks and docs for build tools
	Prompted by a report from Ed Avis:
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/14710>

	* README-hacking: Organise LZMA and Valgrind as
	as optional requirements rather than in their own sections.
	Mention bootstrap will now check tool versions.
	* README-prereq: Make a start on specific instructions
	for optaining build tools. Currently we just have notes
	for Fedora linux.
	* bootstrap.conf: Add the list of tools and versions required.
	* bootstrap: Add the logic to check for the required tools,
	and list all required tools and versions if any are missing.

2008-10-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	clean up gl/modules/selinux-at
	* gl/modules/selinux-at:
	Ensure that LIB_SELINUX is cleared, in case it's set in the environment.
	m4-quote the first two args to AC_SEARCH_LIBS.
	Don't violate autoconf's ac_ namespace: s/ac_save/gl_save/
	Drop the useless double quotes around a simple assignment RHS.

2008-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	move selinux-h module from gl/ to gnulib
	* gl/lib/se-context.in.h: Remove file.
	* gl/lib/se-selinux.in.h: Likewise.
	* gl/m4/selinux-context-h.m4: Likewise.
	* gl/m4/selinux-selinux-h.m4: Likewise.
	* gl/modules/selinux-h: Likewise.

	prepare to move selinux-h module to gnulib
	* gl/modules/selinux-h (Makefile.am)
	[selinux/selinux.h, selinux/context.h]:
	Remove temporary file and target, in case they're read-only.
	Use $(MKDIR_P), not mkdir -p.
	(License): Relax to LGPLv2+.
	Remove vestigial comments.

	tests: test today's ls-vs-capability fix
	Test for this fix: f3f1ccfd871ee395e7fafc051c1b7dedb39fdfc9.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add ls/no-cap.
	* tests/ls/no-cap: New file.

2008-10-21  Kamil Dudka  <kdudka@redhat.com>

	ls: make it possible to disable file capabilities checking
	* ls.c (print_color_indicator): Do not check for file capability
	if that attribute is not being colored.
	Since 84f6abfe00b4ab533145623638b417a2221f9c75, ls --color would check
	each file for "capabilities".  In <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/467508>,
	James Antill reported that ls --color seemed slower with capabilities
	detection.

2008-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	reflect gnulib's removal of lstat.h
	* src/copy.h: Don't include "lstat.h".
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.
	* src/remove.c: Likewise.
	* src/rm.c: Likewise.

2008-10-20  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	expr: Fixup authors
	* src/expr.c: Standardise the format of AUTHORS to
	that used in other utils with multiple authors.
	Also add Paul Eggert since he basically rewrote it
	with his bignum fixes.
	* AUTHORS (expr): Add Paul Eggert.

2008-10-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	accommodate gnulib header removals
	* src/copy.c: Don't include "euidaccess.h" or "lchmod.h".
	* src/cp.c: Don't include "lchmod.h".
	* src/ls.c: Don't include "dirfd.h".
	* src/mkdir.c: Don't include "lchmod.h".
	* src/pwd.c: Don't include "dirfd.h".
	* src/remove.c: Don't include "dirfd.h" or "euidaccess.h".
	* src/test.c: Don't include "euidaccess.h".
	* gl/modules/getloadavg.diff: Adjust diff for changed context.
	* src/uptime.c (uptime): Remove declaration.

2008-10-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* maint.mk (coreutils-path-check): New definition, now run
	only if src/true.c exists.  Factored out of...
	(my-distcheck):  ...here.

2008-10-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: avoid warning in ls.c
	* src/ls.c (has_capability) [!HAVE_CAP]: Add unused attribute.

	maint: avoid warnings due to attribute warn_unused_result
	Now that a (void) cast no longer suffices to ignore warnings from gcc
	about uses of functions marked with the warn_unused_result attribute,
	we need an alternative.  For the record, here's one of the ignorable
	warnings: "copy.c:233: warning: ignoring return value of 'fchown',
	declared with attribute warn_unused_result"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Import ignore-value.
	* src/copy.c: Include "ignore-value.h".
	(set_owner): Use ignore_value in place of "(void)" casts,
	to ignore lchown and fchown failures.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise, to ignore lchown failure.
	* src/remove.c (preprocess_dir): Remove unnecessary "(void)" cast.

2008-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	mktemp: diagnose freopen failure
	* src/mktemp [--quiet]: Don't ignore freopen failure.

2008-10-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/mktemp.c (main): Add 'const' twice to avoid GCC warning.

2008-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: when po-check fails, say why and suggest a fix
	* maint.mk (po-check): Before, when this check failed, it just
	spat out a diff mentioning two temporary files.  Now, it tells
	you what's wrong and suggests a fix with a patch using the name
	of the affected file (rather than temporary file names) in the
	diff output.

2008-10-16  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	csplit: prefer sigaction over signal
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Import sigaction.
	* src/csplit.c (sigprocmask, siginterrupt) [SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Delete
	workarounds.
	(interrupt_handler, main): Drop use of signal.  Rely on sigaction
	to block fatal signal during cleanup, and to restore it to default
	in case of nested signals.

2008-10-15  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	tests: add option processing tests for 'expr'
	* tests/misc/expr: Add tests for various combinations
	of options where the first part of the expression
	could be confused with an option.

2008-10-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	expr: remove --bignum and --no-bignum options
	* doc/coreutils.texi (expr invocation): Remove the --bignum and
	--no-bignum options.  They weren't really needed, and they broke
	longstanding (albeit nonportable) scripts.
	* src/expr.c: Don't include <assert.h>.  Include "inttostr.h",
	"long-options.h", "verify.h".  Check at compile-time that
	size_t fits in unsigned long int, as the code assumes this in
	several places.
	(HAVE_GMP): Define to 0 if not defined, for convenience.
	(mpz_t, mpz_clear, mpz_init_set_ui, mpz_init_set_str, mpz_add):
	(mpz_sub, mpz_mul, mpz_tdiv_q, mpz_tdiv_r, mpz_get_str, mpz_sgn):
	(mpz_fits_ulong_p, mpz_get_ui, mpz_out_str):
	Supply substitutes when !HAVE_GMP, which work well enough for
	expr's purposes.
	(mp_integer): Remove.  All integers are gmp, if gmp is available.
	(struct valinfo): Remove 'z' member; no longer needed.  The 'i'
	member is always of type mpz_t.
	(enum arithmetic_mode, MP_NEVER, MP_ALWAYS, MP_AUTO, mode):
	Remove; no longer needed.
	(usage): Remove documentation of --bignum and --no-bignum.
	(integer_overflow): Abort if error misbehaves, to pacify GCC.
	Restore old message on arithmetic overflow, to be conservative.
	(die): Omit exit_status parameter; not needed (is always EXPR_FAILURE).
	(string_too_long, USE_BIGNUM, NO_USE_BIGNUM, long_options):
	Remove; no longer needed.
	(main): Don't use getopt_long; this breaks old nonportable scripts.
	(int_value): Arg is unsigned, in case we have strings whose length
	exceeds LONG_MAX (!).
	(int_value, freev, printv, null, tostring, toarith):
	(eval6, eval4, eval3):
	Always use mpz_ functions, to simplify the code.
	(substr_value): Remove; no longer needed.
	(getsize): Simplify the API: one arg rather than 3.  Don't assume
	unsigned long int fits in size_t.
	(promote, domult, dodivide, doadd): Remove; no longer needed.
	* tests/misc/expr: Don't use --bignum to test for bignum support.
	Instead, use big numbers to test this.

2008-10-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	expr: don't interpret argv[0] as an operand
	* src/expr.c (main): Given a first argument like -22 (negative, with
	two or more digits), expr would decrement optind to 0 and then attempt
	to evaluate argv[0].

	doc: cp, mv: remove mention of deprecated --reply= option
	* doc/coreutils.texi (cp invocation, mv invocation): Don't mention it.

2008-10-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: adjust spacing in ls --help output, for better man formatting
	* src/ls.c (usage): Adjust spacing so the "Exit status:" list
	renders well in the help2man-generated man page.

2008-10-13  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

	doc: ls: clarify exit status description
	* src/ls.c (exit_status): Clarify comments.
	(usage): Clarify exit status description in --help output.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (ls invocation): Clarify exit status documentation
	Reported by Greg Metcalfe in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/446294>.

2008-10-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: reorder tsort/ptx nodes so body and menu ordering are consistent
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tsort invocation, tsort background): Move these
	nodes "down", so that they follow the ptx nodes, thus matching the
	alphabetized order in the menu.
	(tsort background): Make this a subsection.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

	tests: move check-misc targets from src/Makefile.am to maint.mk
	* src/Makefile.am (check): Remove check-misc.
	(check-misc): Remove target.
	* maint.mk (sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks): New target.
	(sc_prohibit_S_IS_definition): New target.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks: New file.
	Andreas Schwab reported that "make check" could fail to detect
	violation of the no-S_IS*-definition policy.

	tests: df: avoid test failure when using mawk
	* tests/df/total-awk: Rewrite to use $PERL, not $AWK.
	mawk can't even count above 2^31.  Reported by Ed Avis.
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/14792/focus=14802
	* tests/df/total-verify: Rename from total-awk.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

2008-10-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: merge from gnulib

2008-10-07  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

	doc: document runcon and chcon in SELinux context section
	* doc/coreutils.texi: Document runcon and chcon.
	Add minimal SELinux context section.

2008-10-06  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

	chcon: remove traces of unimplemented --change (-c) option
	This option was never supported in upstream coreutils.
	* chcon.c (usage): Remove --change (-c) from help message.
	(main): Remove 'c' from getopt string.
	Remove related and now-unused enums.

2008-10-06  Andreas Dilger  <adilger@sun.com>

	stat: add lustre filesystem type
	* src/stat.c (human_fstype) [S_MAGIC_LUSTRE]: Add case.
	Make "stat -f" recognize the "Lustre" filesystem type.
	<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(file_system)>
	* NEWS: Mention this feature.

2008-10-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	remove.c: avoid compile failure on OS/2
	* src/remove.c (dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful): Guard also with

		* NEWS: Record release date.

	* maint.mk (alpha beta major): Add "-a" to git commit ... command.

2008-10-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: fix the install/strip-program test
	* tests/install/strip-program: Use $PREFERABLY_POSIX_SHELL,
	not POSIX_SHELL.  The latter may be empty, and would fail
	on OpenBSD 3.9.
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Propagate
	PREFERABLY_POSIX_SHELL to tests.

2008-10-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	timeout.c: don't use perror; exit 125 upon failed fork
	* src/timeout.c (main): Use "error", not perror.
	Elbert Pol noticed a build failure on OS/2.
	* src/timeout.c (main): Exit 125 (not errno) upon failed fork.
	Make the failed fork diagnostic match the one from install.c.

2008-10-03  Kamil Dudka  <kdudka@redhat.com>

	ls and sort: use filevercmp instead of strverscmp
	* src/ls.c (cmp_version): Use filevercmp instead of strverscmp.

	(compare_version): Use filevercmp instead of strverscmp.
	* bootstrap.conf: Add filevercmp to list of gnulib modules.
	* tests/misc/sort-version: Remove conflicting string and enhance test.
	* NEWS: Mention the change.

2008-10-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	ignore additional built file

	remove.c: allow compilation on cygwin
	* src/remove.c (dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful)

	in trying to use it.

2008-10-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: merge from gnulib
	* bootstrap: add submodule support, git-merge-changelog

2008-10-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	remove.c: combine two helper functions, to avoid sign-extension
	* src/remove.c (fs_handles_readdir_ordered_dirents_efficiently):
	Remove function, so as not to have to worry about the type of
	statfs.f_type and sign extension.
	(dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful): Adjust comment.
	Perform the switch directly on the struct.member here, instead.
	Andreas Schwab spotted the potential for a sign-extension bug,
	that happens not to bite for the S_* f_type values currently used.

	rm: don't preprocess a directory on a file system of type tmpfs or nfs
	The preprocessing phase is not necessary on tmpfs, and induces
	a 20% performance decrease when removing a 2M-entry directory.
	* src/remove.c (fs_handles_readdir_ordered_dirents_efficiently):
	(dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful): New functions from gnulib/fts.c.
	They'll probably become a gnulib module -- eventually.
	(preprocess_dir): Use dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful.

	tests: use our new timeout program
	* tests/rm/ext3-perf: Also, record set-up duration and FS type.

2008-09-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	fix make variable quotation error
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Quote shell variable

	seq: solve e13188e7ef7bbd609c1586332a335b4194b881aa more cleanly
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Don't switch c_strtold -> strtold
	in order to accommodate the locale-dependent behavior of our internal
	asprintf use.  Instead, simply set the locale to C before calling
	asprintf, and then set it back afterwards.

2008-09-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid spurious valgrind warning about uses of touch
	* .vg-suppressions (utimensat-NULL): Avoid bogus valgrind warning
	that appears on at least Fedora 9.

	THANKS: add Erik Auerswald

2008-09-28  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	remove.c: avoid compiler warning

	[!HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE]: Mask declaration when unused.

2008-09-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	rm -r: avoid O(n^2) performance for a directory with very many entries
	This enhancement works around a problem that is specific to at least
	ext3 and ext4 file systems.  With them, it would take hours to remove
	a two-million-entry directory.  RAM-backed file systems (tmpfs) are
	not affected, since there is no seek penalty.
	* remove.c (rm_malloc, rm_free, compare_ino): New functions.
	(dirent_count, preprocess_dir): New function.
	[struct readdir_data]: New struct.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Call preprocess_dir.
	* tests/rm/ext3-perf: New file.  Test for the performance fix.
	* NEWS: mention the new feature

	remove.c: don't use xmalloc; don't let obstack call exit on failure
	(obstack_chunk_alloc, obstack_chunk_free): Don't define.
	(top_dir): Param is no longer "const".
	Use malloc, not xmalloc, and call longjmp upon failed malloc.
	(obstack_init_minimal): New function.
	(ds_init): Don't use xmalloc.  Instead, use caller-supplied buffer.
	Use obstack_specify_allocation_with_arg, not obstack_init, so
	that we control what happens upon allocation failure.
	Arrange for ds_free not to free uninitialized if/when
	any obstack_specify_allocation_with_arg allocation fails.
	(ds_free): Don't free DS, now that it's no longer malloc'd.
	(rm): Allocate DS on the stack.
	Arrange to handle ds_init allocation failure.

	step1

	* maint.mk (my-distcheck): remove duplicate c99-related test code

	maint: allow more C99 constructs; stop maintaining c99-to-c89 patch set
	* cfg.mk (local-checks-to-skip): Add patch-check.
	With the recent changes to remove.c, I no longer wish
	to maintain the c99-to-c89 patch set.

2008-09-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	seq -0.1 0.1 2: print final number when locale's decimal point is ","
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Use strtold, not c_strtold to convert
	from just-formatted-using-asprintf string back to double, since
	asprintf may have used something other than "." as the decimal point.
	Reported by lsof@nodata.co.uk as <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/463556>.
	Thanks to Ondřej Vašík for discovering that the bug was locale-related.

	    [Exit 1]
	    $ seq -0.1 0.1 2|grep 2.0
	    2.0

	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add LOCALE_FR_UTF8, for...
	* tests/misc/seq [locale-dec-pt]: New test for the above.
	* NEWS (bug fix): Mention it.

	maint: relax a check so "make distcheck" succeeds again
	* maint.mk (makefile-check): Relax the check, in order to exempt
	the necessary use of a sole @...@-delimited Makefile.am variable.

2008-09-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: avoid using find -name Makefile.am; could get false positives
	* maint.mk (makefile-check): Instead, search for the offending
	@...@ construct only in version-controlled files.

	fix installation with ./ginstall in src
	* src/Makefile.am (cu_install_program): New variable, set to

	* doc/coreutils.texi (who invocation): Alphabetize.

2008-09-19  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	who --help: add a general description

	uptime --help: put together message parts that belong together

	tr --help: gettextize a single paragraph as a single string
	Breaking a paragraph into several strings is awkward for translators.

	tail: gettextize the string, "standard input"

	tail --help: move the --retry entry into alphabetical order
	* src/tail.c (usage): Also simplify --retry description, split a
	long string in two, remove a stray period, and add the usual indent.

	shred --help: lowercase a stray capital

	stty --help: correct the alignment of an entry
	* src/stty.c (usage): Also remove a stray period, and ungettextize
	a debugging message.

	sort --help: sort the options better alphabetically
	Take the opportunity to split the long message into three parts.

	truncate: ignore whitespace in --size parameters
	Without this, `truncate -s '> -1' F` would truncate F to length 0,
	and `truncate -s " +1" F` would truncate F to 1 byte.  Now, each
	elicits a diagnostic.
	* src/truncate.c: Skip leading white space in the --size option
	argument and any white space after one of the relative modifiers,
	so that the presence of a +/- modifier can be detected reliably.

	timeout: fix invalid argument tests
	* tests/misc/timeout-parameters: Remove test for invalid
	signal number (we don't know what signal numbers are
	invalid on all systems). Also tweak the other invalid
	signal check so that the rest of the arguments are correct.

2008-06-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	avoid a -Wsign-compare warning

2008-06-27  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	truncate: Fix integer portability issues
	* src/truncate.c: Explicitly convert from off_t to intmax_t
	when printing numbers as they may be different types.
	Also don't mix size_t and off_t types in operations as
	the latter will be promoted to unsigned when these types
	are the same size.

2008-06-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Based on a patch from Peter O'Gorman.

	* HACKING: use shorter "-1" (over HEAD~1) with git format-patch

	bootstrap.conf: don't list "open" specifically
	It is no longer necessary to list it specifically,
	now that several gnulib modules depend on the "open" module.
	This reverts commit 3ea1fe588e20f196cc9b9907d5943bd620c6b944.

	truncate: handle the case in which off_t != intmax_t
	* src/truncate.c (parse_len): Use a temporary of type intmax_t,

	address root cause of compilation failures:
	The affected code wasn't even being compiled on my system,
	because HAVE_NL_LANGINFO was not defined.  On other systems, where
	vasnprintf.m4 determines it needs %A or %a replacement support, it
	_would_ check for nl_langinfo, and expose the compilation failure.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4: Check for nl_langinfo, required by sort.c.

	fix the compilation failure for real
	* src/sort.c (monthtab): Neither "const" may be added.

	envvar-check, so that the few scripts that require $TMPDIR don't fail.
	This is also good to let a user's default TMPDIR setting be used e.g.,

	subdirectory, adjust the full name of the "rm" program we're going

	tests: allow to run Perl tests more cleanly
	Before this change, perl tests were run via a #!/bin/sh script

	nominally automake-internal variable.

	Before, upon interrupt, directories would be left behind.
	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm: Remove temporary directory on interrupt.

	tests: reorder some tests in the long list
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Move some tests that use sleep
	"up" in the list so that they don't delay even a little the
	completion of "make check".  Also run a chmod test early.

	tests: put root-only (usually skipped) tests at the end
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Don't list root-only tests explicitly.
	Instead, just use $(root_tests).
	* tests/check.mk (vc_exe_in_TESTS): Now that root_tests are separate,
	parse out the union of $(TESTS) and $(root_tests).

	tests: move another file (expensive) into test-lib.sh
	* tests/expensive: Remove file.  Move contents into ...
	* tests/test-lib.sh (expensive_): ...here.  New function.

	* tests/mv/leak-fd: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/hash: Likewise.
	* tests/tail-2/big-4gb: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove its name.

	tests: cp/perm (usually not run) was failing on systems with SELinux
	* tests/cp/perm: Use stat to get the permission string, not ls.
	This test was run only when RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes was set
	in the environment.  It would fail on SELinux-enable systems
	because ls-generated permission strings would not match, e.g.,
	"test _-rw-r--r--+ = _-rw-r--r--" would fail.

	id: do print the AFS-specific nameless group ID (called a PAG)
	In 6.11, we mistakenly suppressed the printing of certain group IDs,
	thinking they were useless AFS-specific artifacts.
	This change reverts that, so now they are printed once again.
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.fsf.announce/867/focus=13345
	This also reverts the bug-fix that applied solely to the new code
	used to avoid printing those IDs

	Revert "id bug fix: don't point to potentially clobbered static storage"
	This reverts commit f7d1c59c224f81a8bab5fa2afcaf815988f50467.
	Revert "Work around AFS bug: id and groups would print invalid group number."
	This reverts commit b7a836c0a3524cda8ef79c30c3fe7ea759ae4656.
	Revert "* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Accommodate a C99-ism in id.c."

	Suggestion from Eric Blake.

	Accommodate building on OS/2 (www.ecomstation.com Ecs v2 rc4)
	* configure.ac: Filter out carriage returns in more places.
	Reported by Elbert Pol, details here:

	guard against inserting a NEWS entry into a block for a prior release
	Without a guard like this, it is far too easy to apply a patch

	tests: skip (don't fail) rm/one-file-system when mount --bind fails
	* tests/rm/one-file-system: Reported by Allen Hewes.

	* tests/mkdir/perm: Use the function rather than sourcing the file.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Likewise.

	tests: adjust perl -I to use $top_srcdir/tests, not $srcdir/..

	tests: clean up root tests; adapt to new layout
	* tests/Makefile.am (root_tests): New list.
	(check-root): Add 'SUBDIRS='.
	(root-hint): Point to README.
	* Makefile.am (check-root): Add 'SUBDIRS=' here, too.
	* maint.mk (sc_root_tests): Adapt rule to new syntax used
	in tests/Makefile.am.

	Revamp test-related Makefiles.
	One side-effect of this change is that "make check" now works even if
	you put "." early in your shell's search PATH (don't do that!).

	Remove all test-related Makefile.am files, except those generated
	by mk-script.  Instead, tests/Makefile.am now lists not only the
	tests directly under tests/, but also those in tests/*/ that are
	not generated by mk-script, e.g., cp/abuse, cp/acl, mv/i-1, etc.

	A lot of these changes are like this:

	+. $top_srcdir/tests/test-lib.sh

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove corresponding Makefiles.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove rwx-to-mode.
	(SUBDIRS): Remove each dir with a removed Makefile.am.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add $(TESTS).
	(TESTS): Add over 300 entries.

	* tests/mkdir/selinux: Undo most of previous change,
	bc22dbbf844f31ddaf2e68b167d0128a985d73ab, and instead
	invoke the command via "nice".  Using "exec" should be

	Eric Blake suggested using nice.

	mknod --help: note that this command may be a shell built-in

	option to precede all others, to avoid a warning.

	* bootstrap: Remove dangling symlinks from lib (aka $source_base), too.

	Avoid root-only SELinux-related test failures w/o mcstransd.
	When mcstransd is not running (i.e., after service mcstrans stop),
	"make check" as root would provoke two test failures.
	* tests/cp/cp-a-selinux: Use the context, root:object_r:tmp_t:s0,

	join bug fix: adapt keycmp to work with new order-checking feature
	* src/join.c (keycmp): Add two join-field parameters.
	(check_order, join): Update callers.
	Reported by Dmitry V. Levin in
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/12731/focus=13017
	* tests/join/Test.pm (chkodr-7): New test for this fix.

	(key_cmp): Move definition to precede first use.

2008-03-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	portability: work around a "busybox sed" limitation
	* configure.ac: While every other sed tested supports usage like
	'/\(re\)/{s//\1/;...<NEWLINE>}', and POSIX appears to requires this,
	busybox's sed does not support it.  So duplicate the regexp:
	'/\(re\)/{s/\(re\)/\1/;...<NEWLINE>}'.  Reported by Vincent Lefevre:
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/13013>.

	ptx: avoid heap overrun for backslash at end of optarg string
	* src/ptx.c (copy_unescaped_string): Ignore a lone backslash
	at end of string.  Reported by Cristian Cadar, Daniel Dunbar
	and Dawson Engler.  Details here:

2008-03-21  Ingo Weinhold  <ingo_weinhold@gmx.de>

	remove.c: Accommodate systems with negative errno values.
	* src/remove.c (cache_fstatat): Store errno value directly in
	the st_ino field, rather than trying to shoehorn it into st_size.
	This is required at least on BeOS and Haiku.

2008-03-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/seq.c (long_double_format): Add a comment.

	* GNUmakefile: Update from gnulib.

2008-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Remove today's automake kludge, altogether.  Fix properly.
	* man/Makefile.am: Use dist_man1_MANS instead of dist_man_MANS.
	Suggestion from Ralf Wildenhues.

	Add a check to detect this problem, in case it reappears.
	* maint.mk (my-distcheck): Run "make install", and then ensure
	that ls.1 is installed.

	Kludge to make automake generate install-man rules
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add a literal, rm.1.
	Without this, "make install" would not install man pages.
	However, with this kludge, the rm.1 man page is installed
	even when you configure with --enable-no-install-program=rm.

	Revert recent man/Makefile.am change.
	Revert 4b544e447eb78fd1f031a026a499f6aed177808a.
	* man/Makefile.am: That change was only a band-aid.  It solved
	the stated problem, but not a deeper one: that "make install"
	would no longer man pages.  Reported by Dmitry V. Levin.
	The latter problem arose in
	167b8025aca487de001da2448c1aebc2747bc1d3 with the removal of
	the sole literal from the definition of dist_man_MANS.  When
	automake perceives dist_man_MANS as empty, it no longer emits
	the install-man* rules.

	(VC_LIST_EXCEPT): Rename from CVS_LIST_EXCEPT.

	mv: never unlink a destination file before calling rename
	While cp --preserve=links must unlink certain destination files,
	mv must never do that.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Pull the '! x->move_mode' test "up",
	so it affects the entire condition, and not just DEREF_NEVER mode.
	Reported by James Ralston in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/438076>.
	* tests/mv/atomic2: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add atomic2.

	* GNUmakefile: Include optional file, GNUmakefile.cfg.
	Autoconf will use this to override _autoreconf and to export PATH.
	(_autoreconf): Define.
	(_dummy): cd to $(srcdir) before removing autom4te.cache.

	* bootstrap: Sync from gnulib and remove part of a local kludge.

2008-03-10  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

2008-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Accommodate a C99-ism in id.c.

2008-03-05  ribalba  <geerd.dietger.hoffmann@gmail.com>

	Work around AFS bug: id and groups would print invalid group number.
	* src/id.c (main): Call print_group_list with a user name, if possible.
	* src/groups.c (main): Likewise.
	* NEWS: Mention this.
	For details, see

	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/12875

2008-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Now that Makefile.maint is used in VPATH builds, too...
	* Makefile.maint (prev_version_file): Prefix with $(srcdir)/.
	(syntax-check-rules): Prefix $(ME) with $(srcdir)/.

	Avoid new "make distcheck" failure, now that VPATH has GNUmakefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Remove commands to create ".version".
	They were unnecessary, and caused creation of a newer .version
	file in a VPATH build, which in turn caused creation of updated
	man/*.1 files reflecting the newer time stamp on .version.
	Those *.1 files were not removed (since they're distributed), and
	the fact that they remained after "distclean" triggered the failure.

2008-03-04  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Reinstate GNUmakefile patch, but with workaround for automake.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_LINKS): Use shell variable to bypass
	automake distclean rules.
	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Clean GNUmakefile in VPATH builds,
	since we are bypassing automake.
	* GNUmakefile (_is-dist-target): 'distclean' is not a dist target.

2008-03-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Clarify comment and attribute preceding change: Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Comment out yesterday's VPATH-friendly addition, for now.
	* configure.ac: ...while we wait for a fixed version of automake.

2008-03-03  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Use m4_PACKAGE_VERSION, not AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION.
	* configure.ac: The latter is only in post-2.61 autoconf.

	GNUmakefile build tweaks.
	* GNUmakefile: When Makefile is not present, make common targets depend
	on "all" in order to trigger nicer error message.
	* configure.ac: If autoconf is new enough, link GNUmakefile into VPATH
	builds.
	For more details, see
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/12853>.

2008-03-03  Simon Josefsson  <simon@josefsson.org>

	* GNUmakefile: Add $(srcdir)/ prefix to git-version-gen and argument.

2008-03-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	One more for non-srcdir "make dist".
	* GNUmakefile: Also cd $(srcdir) before running autoreconf.

	Adjust so that non-srcdir "make dist" works, too.

	Don't skip the groups-version test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (built_programs): Remove unused definition.
	* src/Makefile.am (built_programs.list): Print a space-separated
	list of program names, not NL-separated, since all clients now
	expect a space-separated list.

	Don't exempt "groups" from write-failure test, now that it's a C program.
	* tests/misc/help-version: Since groups is no longer a shell
	script, a buggy bourne shell can't cause trouble.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Use .tarball-version, not .version.

	Don't depend on gnulib's deprecated "free" module.
	* bootstrap.conf (obsolete_gnulib_modules): Remove free.
	* gl/modules/mgetgroups (Depends-on): Remove free.

	Merge bootstrap changes from gnulib.

	Make copyright comments consistent.
	* src/mktemp.c: Update copyright to use newer form.

	Make first copyright lines consistent. Some did not end in ", Inc.".
	Due to that missing ", Inc" at end of line, emacs' copyright-updating
	code missed some opportunities.  This corrects most of those, and

	(free_prevline): new atexit function; frees items in prevline[].
	Use ARRAY_CARDINALITY, so include "argmatch.h" to get that.
	(main): Arrange for free_prevline to be called during exit.

	Remove xdelta support, clean up distcheck process. * Makefile.maint (writable-files): Don't create $(release_archive_dir). (my-distcheck): Don't depend on prev-tgz. Remove xdelta-related variables and uses. (alpha beta major): Skip steps if $(release_archive_dir) doesn't exist.
