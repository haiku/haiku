.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK_NAME.
If LINK_NAME is omitted, a link with the same basename as the TARGET is
created in the current directory.  When using the second form with more
than one TARGET, the last argument must be a directory;  create links
in DIRECTORY to each TARGET.  Create hard links by default, symbolic
links with \fB\-\-symbolic\fR.  When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
