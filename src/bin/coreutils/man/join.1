.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
For each pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line to
standard output.  The default join field is the first, delimited
by whitespace.  When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is \-, read standard input.

FILENUM is 1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1 or FILE2

.TP
\fB\-2\fR FIELD

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
Unless \fB\-t\fR CHAR is given, leading blanks separate fields and are ignored,
else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field number counted
from 1.  FORMAT is one or more comma or blank separated specifications,
each being `FILENUM.FIELD' or `0'.  Default FORMAT outputs the join field,
the remaining fields from FILE1, the remaining fields from FILE2, all
separated by CHAR.
.PP
Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.
