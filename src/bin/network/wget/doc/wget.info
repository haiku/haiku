1 Overview
**********

GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
retrieval through HTTP proxies.

   This chapter is a partial overview of Wget's features.

   * Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
     background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
     start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
     finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
     constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when
     transferring a lot of data.

   * Wget can follow links in HTML and XHTML pages and create local
     versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory
     structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as
     "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the
     Robot Exclusion Standard (`/robots.txt').  Wget can be instructed
     to convert the links in downloaded HTML files to the local files
     for offline viewing.

   * File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories
     are available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the
     time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and
     store it locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has
     changed since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new
     version if it has.  This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP
     sites, as well as home pages.

   * Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
     connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
     keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the
     server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue
     the download from where it left off.

   * Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load,
     speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  Wget uses
     the passive FTP downloading by default, active FTP being an option.

   * Wget supports IP version 6, the next generation of IP.  IPv6 is
     autodetected at compile-time, and can be disabled at either build
     or run time.  Binaries built with IPv6 support work well in both
     IPv4-only and dual family environments.

   * Built-in features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to
     follow (*note Following Links::).

   * The progress of individual downloads is traced using a progress
     gauge.  Interactive downloads are tracked using a
     "thermometer"-style gauge, whereas non-interactive ones are traced
     with dots, each dot representing a fixed amount of data received
     (1KB by default).  Either gauge can be customized to your
     preferences.

   * Most of the features are fully configurable, either through
     command line options, or via the initialization file `.wgetrc'
     (*note Startup File::).  Wget allows you to define "global"
     startup files (`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default) for site
     settings.

   * Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may
     use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
     GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software
     Foundation (see the file `COPYING' that came with GNU Wget, for
     details).

2 Invoking
**********

By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

     wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

   Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command
line.  URL is a "Uniform Resource Locator", as defined below.

   However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to `.wgetrc' (*note Startup File::), or specifying it on the
command line.

File: wget.info,  Node: URL Format,  Next: Option Syntax,  Up: Invoking

2.1 URL Format
==============

"URL" is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform resource
locator is a compact string representation for a resource available via
the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per RFC1738.  This is
the most widely used form (square brackets denote optional parts):

     http://host[:port]/directory/file
     ftp://host[:port]/directory/file

   You can also encode your username and password within a URL:

     ftp://user:password@host/path
     http://user:password@host/path

   Either USER or PASSWORD, or both, may be left out.  If you leave out
either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent.
If you leave out the FTP username, `anonymous' will be used.  If you
leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a
default password.(1)

   *Important Note*: if you specify a password-containing URL on the
command line, the username and password will be plainly visible to all
users on the system, by way of `ps'.  On multi-user systems, this is a
big security risk.  To work around it, use `wget -i -' and feed the
URLs to Wget's standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by
`C-d'.

   You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as `%xy', `xy' being the
hexadecimal representation of the character's ASCII value.  Some common
unsafe characters include `%' (quoted as `%25'), `:' (quoted as `%3A'),
and `@' (quoted as `%40').  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list
of unsafe characters.

   Wget also supports the `type' feature for FTP URLs.  By default, FTP
documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type `i'), which means that
they are downloaded unchanged.  Another useful mode is the `a'
("ASCII") mode, which converts the line delimiters between the
different operating systems, and is thus useful for text files.  Here
is an example:

     ftp://host/directory/file;type=a

   Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their widespreaded use.

   FTP-only syntax (supported by `NcFTP'):
     host:/dir/file

   HTTP-only syntax (introduced by `Netscape'):
     host[:port]/dir/file

   These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

   If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or
do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like `Lynx' or `Netscape'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you have a `.netrc' file in your home directory, password
will also be searched for there.

2.2 Option Syntax
=================

Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:

     wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log

   The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
may be omitted.  Instead of `-o log' you can write `-olog'.

   You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

     wget -drc URL

   This is a complete equivalent of:

     wget -d -r -c URL

   Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with `--'.  So the following will try to download URL
`-x', reporting failure to `log':

     wget -o log -- -x

   The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
useful to clear the `.wgetrc' settings.  For instance, if your `.wgetrc'
sets `exclude_directories' to `/cgi-bin', the following example will
first reset it, and then set it to exclude `/~nobody' and `/~somebody'.
You can also clear the lists in `.wgetrc' (*note Wgetrc Syntax::).

     wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody

   Most options that do not accept arguments are "boolean" options, so
named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no ("boolean")
variable.  For example, `--follow-ftp' tells Wget to follow FTP links
from HTML files and, on the other hand, `--no-glob' tells it not to
perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A boolean option is either
"affirmative" or "negative" (beginning with `--no').  All such options
share several properties.

   Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the
documented existence of `--follow-ftp' assumes that the default is to
_not_ follow FTP links from HTML pages.

   Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the `--no-' to the
option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the `--no-'
prefix.  This might seem superfluous--if the default for an affirmative
option is to not do something, then why provide a way to explicitly
turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change the default.  For
instance, using `follow_ftp = off' in `.wgetrc' makes Wget _not_ follow
FTP links by default, and using `--no-follow-ftp' is the only way to
restore the factory default from the command line.

2.3 Basic Startup Options
=========================

`-V'
`--version'
     Display the version of Wget.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.

`-b'
`--background'
     Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
     specified via the `-o', output is redirected to `wget-log'.

`-e COMMAND'
`--execute COMMAND'
     Execute COMMAND as if it were a part of `.wgetrc' (*note Startup
     File::).  A command thus invoked will be executed _after_ the
     commands in `.wgetrc', thus taking precedence over them.  If you
     need to specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple
     instances of `-e'.



File: wget.info,  Node: Logging and Input File Options,  Next: Download Options,  Prev: Basic Startup Options,  Up: Invoking

2.4 Logging and Input File Options
==================================

`-o LOGFILE'
`--output-file=LOGFILE'
     Log all messages to LOGFILE.  The messages are normally reported
     to standard error.

`-a LOGFILE'
`--append-output=LOGFILE'
     Append to LOGFILE.  This is the same as `-o', only it appends to
     LOGFILE instead of overwriting the old log file.  If LOGFILE does
     not exist, a new file is created.

`-d'
`--debug'
     Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
     developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
     administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
     support, in which case `-d' will not work.  Please note that
     compiling with debug support is always safe--Wget compiled with
     the debug support will _not_ print any debug info unless requested
     with `-d'.  *Note Reporting Bugs::, for more information on how to
     use `-d' for sending bug reports.

`-q'
`--quiet'
     Turn off Wget's output.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
     output is verbose.

`-nv'
`--no-verbose'
     Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use `-q' for
     that), which means that error messages and basic information still
     get printed.

`-i FILE'
`--input-file=FILE'
     Read URLs from FILE.  If `-' is specified as FILE, URLs are read
     from the standard input.  (Use `./-' to read from a file literally
     named `-'.)

     If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
     line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input
     file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be
     retrieved.  The FILE need not be an HTML document (but no harm if
     it is)--it is enough if the URLs are just listed sequentially.

     However, if you specify `--force-html', the document will be
     regarded as `html'.  In that case you may have problems with
     relative links, which you can solve either by adding `<base
     href="URL">' to the documents or by specifying `--base=URL' on the
     command line.

`-F'
`--force-html'
     When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
     file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
     HTML files on your local disk, by adding `<base href="URL">' to
     HTML, or using the `--base' command-line option.

`-B URL'
`--base=URL'
     Prepends URL to relative links read from the file specified with
     the `-i' option.


File: wget.info,  Node: Download Options,  Next: Directory Options,  Prev: Logging and Input File Options,  Up: Invoking

2.5 Download Options
====================

`--bind-address=ADDRESS'
     When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to ADDRESS on the
     local machine.  ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or IP
     address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound to
     multiple IPs.

`-t NUMBER'
`--tries=NUMBER'
     Set number of retries to NUMBER.  Specify 0 or `inf' for infinite
     retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of
     fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not found" (404), which
     are not retried.

`-O FILE'
`--output-document=FILE'
     The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
     will be concatenated together and written to FILE.  If `-' is used
     as FILE, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling
     link conversion.  (Use `./-' to print to a file literally named
     `-'.)

     Use of `-O' is _not_ intended to mean simply "use the name FILE
     instead of the one in the URL;" rather, it is analogous to shell
     redirection: `wget -O file http://foo' is intended to work like
     `wget -O - http://foo > file'; `file' will be truncated
     immediately, and _all_ downloaded content will be written there.

     For this reason, `-N' (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in
     combination with `-O': since FILE is always newly created, it will
     always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this
     combination is used.

     Similarly, using `-r' or `-p' with `-O' may not work as you
     expect: Wget won't just download the first file to FILE and then
     download the rest to their normal names: _all_ downloaded content
     will be placed in FILE. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has
     been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some
     cases where this behavior can actually have some use.

     Note that a combination with `-k' is only permitted when
     downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert
     all relative URIs to external ones; `-k' makes no sense for
     multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file.

`-nc'
`--no-clobber'
     If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
     Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including `-nc'.  In
     certain cases, the local file will be "clobbered", or overwritten,
     upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

     When running Wget without `-N', `-nc', `-r', or `p', downloading
     the same file in the same directory will result in the original
     copy of FILE being preserved and the second copy being named
     `FILE.1'.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy
     will be named `FILE.2', and so on.  When `-nc' is specified, this
     behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer
     copies of `FILE'.  Therefore, "`no-clobber'" is actually a
     misnomer in this mode--it's not clobbering that's prevented (as
     the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but
     rather the multiple version saving that's prevented.

     When running Wget with `-r' or `-p', but without `-N' or `-nc',
     re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
     overwriting the old.  Adding `-nc' will prevent this behavior,
     instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer
     copies on the server to be ignored.

     When running Wget with `-N', with or without `-r' or `-p', the
     decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file
     depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file
     (*note Time-Stamping::).  `-nc' may not be specified at the same
     time as `-N'.

     Note that when `-nc' is specified, files with the suffixes `.html'
     or `.htm' will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they
     had been retrieved from the Web.

`-c'
`--continue'
     Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
     you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
     Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

          wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

     If there is a file named `ls-lR.Z' in the current directory, Wget
     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
     will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
     to the length of the local file.

     Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want
     the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
     the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
     behavior.  `-c' only affects resumption of downloads started
     _prior_ to this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are
     still sitting around.

     Without `-c', the previous example would just download the remote
     file to `ls-lR.Z.1', leaving the truncated `ls-lR.Z' file alone.

     Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use `-c' on a non-empty file, and
     it turns out that the server does not support continued
     downloading, Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch,
     which would effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really
     want the download to start from scratch, remove the file.

     Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use `-c' on a file which is of
     equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download
     the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when
     the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because
     it was changed on the server since your last download
     attempt)--because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
     occurs.

     On the other side of the coin, while using `-c', any file that's
     bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
     download and only `(length(remote) - length(local))' bytes will be
     downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
     behavior can be desirable in certain cases--for instance, you can
     use `wget -c' to download just the new portion that's been
     appended to a data collection or log file.

     However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
     _changed_, as opposed to just _appended_ to, you'll end up with a
     garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
     really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
     especially careful of this when using `-c' in conjunction with
     `-r', since every file will be considered as an "incomplete
     download" candidate.

     Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
     `-c' is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
     interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
     "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

     Note that `-c' only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers
     that support the `Range' header.

`--progress=TYPE'
     Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
     indicators are "dot" and "bar".

     The "bar" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII progress
     bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) indicating the status of
     retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the "dot" bar will be used
     by default.

     Use `--progress=dot' to switch to the "dot" display.  It traces
     the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot
     representing a fixed amount of downloaded data.

     When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the "style" by
     specifying the type as `dot:STYLE'.  Different styles assign
     different meaning to one dot.  With the `default' style each dot
     represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a
     line.  The `binary' style has a more "computer"-like
     orientation--8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which
     makes for 384K lines).  The `mega' style is suitable for
     downloading very large files--each dot represents 64K retrieved,
     there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so
     each line contains 3M).

     Note that you can set the default style using the `progress'
     command in `.wgetrc'.  That setting may be overridden from the
     command line.  The exception is that, when the output is not a
     TTY, the "dot" progress will be favored over "bar".  To force the
     bar output, use `--progress=bar:force'.

`-N'
`--timestamping'
     Turn on time-stamping.  *Note Time-Stamping::, for details.

`-S'
`--server-response'
     Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
     servers.

`--spider'
     When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web "spider",
     which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
     they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to check your
     bookmarks:

          wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

     This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
     functionality of real web spiders.

`-T seconds'
`--timeout=SECONDS'
     Set the network timeout to SECONDS seconds.  This is equivalent to
     specifying `--dns-timeout', `--connect-timeout', and
     `--read-timeout', all at the same time.

     When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
     abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
     like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout
     enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a
     timeout to 0 disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are
     doing, it is best not to change the default timeout settings.

     All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
     subsecond values.  For example, `0.1' seconds is a legal (though
     unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for
     checking server response times or for testing network latency.

`--dns-timeout=SECONDS'
     Set the DNS lookup timeout to SECONDS seconds.  DNS lookups that
     don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By default,
     there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that implemented by
     system libraries.

`--connect-timeout=SECONDS'
     Set the connect timeout to SECONDS seconds.  TCP connections that
     take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
     connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.

`--read-timeout=SECONDS'
     Set the read (and write) timeout to SECONDS seconds.  The "time"
     of this timeout refers to "idle time": if, at any point in the
     download, no data is received for more than the specified number
     of seconds, reading fails and the download is restarted.  This
     option does not directly affect the duration of the entire
     download.

     Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
     sooner than this option requires.  The default read timeout is 900
     seconds.

`--limit-rate=AMOUNT'
     Limit the download speed to AMOUNT bytes per second.  Amount may
     be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k' suffix, or megabytes
     with the `m' suffix.  For example, `--limit-rate=20k' will limit
     the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
     reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available
     bandwidth.

     This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
     conjunction with power suffixes; for example, `--limit-rate=2.5k'
     is a legal value.

     Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
     amount of time after a network read that took less time than
     specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the TCP
     transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate.
     However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so
     don't be surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with
     very small files.

`-w SECONDS'
`--wait=SECONDS'
     Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
     of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
     making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the
     time can be specified in minutes using the `m' suffix, in hours
     using `h' suffix, or in days using `d' suffix.

     Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
     or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
     to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
     retry.  The waiting interval specified by this function is
     influenced by `--random-wait', which see.

`--waitretry=SECONDS'
     If you don't want Wget to wait between _every_ retrieval, but only
     between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.
     Wget will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first
     failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second
     failure on that file, up to the maximum number of SECONDS you
     specify.  Therefore, a value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up
     to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 seconds per file.

     Note that this option is turned on by default in the global
     `wgetrc' file.

`--random-wait'
     Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
     programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant
     similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the
     time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * WAIT seconds,
     where WAIT was specified using the `--wait' option, in order to
     mask Wget's presence from such analysis.

     A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
     consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the
     fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level
     to ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite
     changing DHCP-supplied addresses.

     The `--random-wait' option was inspired by this ill-advised
     recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due
     to the actions of one.

`--no-proxy'
     Don't use proxies, even if the appropriate `*_proxy' environment
     variable is defined.

     For more information about the use of proxies with Wget, *Note
     Proxies::.

`-Q QUOTA'
`--quota=QUOTA'
     Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
     specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with `k' suffix), or
     megabytes (with `m' suffix).

     Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So
     if you specify `wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz',
     all of the `ls-lR.gz' will be downloaded.  The same goes even when
     several URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
     respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input
     file.  Thus you may safely type `wget -Q2m -i sites'--download
     will be aborted when the quota is exceeded.

     Setting quota to 0 or to `inf' unlimits the download quota.

`--no-dns-cache'
     Turn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the IP
     addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to repeatedly
     contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts
     it retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget
     run will contact DNS again.

     However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
     desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
     short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues
     a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to `gethostbyname' or
     `getaddrinfo') each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
     that this option will _not_ affect caching that might be performed
     by the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as
     NSCD.

     If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you probably
     won't need it.

`--restrict-file-names=MODE'
     Change which characters found in remote URLs may show up in local
     file names generated from those URLs.  Characters that are
     "restricted" by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with `%HH',
     where `HH' is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the
     restricted character.

     By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid as part
     of file names on your operating system, as well as control
     characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful
     for changing these defaults, either because you are downloading to
     a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of
     the control characters.

     When mode is set to "unix", Wget escapes the character `/' and the
     control characters in the ranges 0-31 and 128-159.  This is the
     default on Unix-like OS'es.

     When mode is set to "windows", Wget escapes the characters `\',
     `|', `/', `:', `?', `"', `*', `<', `>', and the control characters
     in the ranges 0-31 and 128-159.  In addition to this, Wget in
     Windows mode uses `+' instead of `:' to separate host and port in
     local file names, and uses `@' instead of `?' to separate the
     query portion of the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL
     that would be saved as `www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah'
     in Unix mode would be saved as
     `www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah' in Windows mode.  This
     mode is the default on Windows.

     If you append `,nocontrol' to the mode, as in `unix,nocontrol',
     escaping of the control characters is also switched off.  You can
     use `--restrict-file-names=nocontrol' to turn off escaping of
     control characters without affecting the choice of the OS to use
     as file name restriction mode.

`-4'
`--inet4-only'
`-6'
`--inet6-only'
     Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With `--inet4-only'
     or `-4', Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA
     records in DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses
     specified in URLs.  Conversely, with `--inet6-only' or `-6', Wget
     will only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4
     addresses.

     Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an
     IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the
     host's DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6
     addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it
     can connect to.  (Also see `--prefer-family' option described
     below.)

     These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
     IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
     debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.  Only one
     of `--inet6-only' and `--inet4-only' may be specified at the same
     time.  Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6
     support.

`--prefer-family=IPv4/IPv6/none'
     When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
     with specified address family first.  IPv4 addresses are preferred
     by default.

     This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing
     hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
     networks.  For example, `www.kame.net' resolves to
     `2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085' and to `203.178.141.194'.
     When the preferred family is `IPv4', the IPv4 address is used
     first; when the preferred family is `IPv6', the IPv6 address is
     used first; if the specified value is `none', the address order
     returned by DNS is used without change.

     Unlike `-4' and `-6', this option doesn't inhibit access to any
     address family, it only changes the _order_ in which the addresses
     are accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by this
     option is "stable"--it doesn't affect order of addresses of the
     same family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses
     and of all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.

`--retry-connrefused'
     Consider "connection refused" a transient error and try again.
     Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the
     site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server
     is not running at all and that retries would not help.  This
     option is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to
     disappear for short periods of time.

`--user=USER'
`--password=PASSWORD'
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for both FTP and
     HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden using the
     `--ftp-user' and `--ftp-password' options for FTP connections and
     the `--http-user' and `--http-password' options for HTTP
     connections.

2.6 Directory Options
=====================

`-nd'
`--no-directories'
     Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
     recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved
     to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
     more than once, the filenames will get extensions `.n').

`-x'
`--force-directories'
     The opposite of `-nd'--create a hierarchy of directories, even if
     one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. `wget -x
     http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt' will save the downloaded file to
     `fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt'.

`-nH'
`--no-host-directories'
     Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
     invoking Wget with `-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/' will create a
     structure of directories beginning with `fly.srk.fer.hr/'.  This
     option disables such behavior.

`--protocol-directories'
     Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file
     names.  For example, with this option, `wget -r http://HOST' will
     save to `http/HOST/...' rather than just to `HOST/...'.

`--cut-dirs=NUMBER'
     Ignore NUMBER directory components.  This is useful for getting a
     fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
     will be saved.

     Take, for example, the directory at
     `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'.  If you retrieve it with `-r',
     it will be saved locally under `ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'.
     While the `-nH' option can remove the `ftp.xemacs.org/' part, you
     are still stuck with `pub/xemacs'.  This is where `--cut-dirs'
     comes in handy; it makes Wget not "see" NUMBER remote directory
     components.  Here are several examples of how `--cut-dirs' option
     works.

          No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
          -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

          --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
          ...

     If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
     option is similar to a combination of `-nd' and `-P'.  However,
     unlike `-nd', `--cut-dirs' does not lose with subdirectories--for
     instance, with `-nH --cut-dirs=1', a `beta/' subdirectory will be
     placed to `xemacs/beta', as one would expect.

`-P PREFIX'
`--directory-prefix=PREFIX'
     Set directory prefix to PREFIX.  The "directory prefix" is the
     directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
     to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is `.' (the
     current directory).

2.7 HTTP Options
================

`-E'
`--html-extension'
     If a file of type `application/xhtml+xml' or `text/html' is
     downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
     `\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?', this option will cause the suffix `.html'
     to be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for
     instance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses `.asp'
     pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your
     stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're
     downloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL like
     `http://site.com/article.cgi?25' will be saved as
     `article.cgi?25.html'.

     Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded
     every time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the
     local `X.html' file corresponds to remote URL `X' (since it
     doesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type `text/html'
     or `application/xhtml+xml'.  To prevent this re-downloading, you
     must use `-k' and `-K' so that the original version of the file
     will be saved as `X.orig' (*note Recursive Retrieval Options::).

`--http-user=USER'
`--http-password=PASSWORD'
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an HTTP server.
     According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them
     using either the `basic' (insecure), the `digest', or the Windows
     `NTLM' authentication scheme.

     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (*note URL Format::).  Either method reveals your password to
     anyone who bothers to run `ps'.  To prevent the passwords from
     being seen, store them in `.wgetrc' or `.netrc', and make sure to
     protect those files from other users with `chmod'.  If the
     passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those
     files either--edit the files and delete them after Wget has
     started the download.

`--no-cache'
     Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote
     server an appropriate directive (`Pragma: no-cache') to get the
     file from the remote service, rather than returning the cached
     version.  This is especially useful for retrieving and flushing
     out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

     Caching is allowed by default.

`--no-cookies'
     Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for
     maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a
     cookie using the `Set-Cookie' header, and the client responds with
     the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the
     server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange
     this information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The
     default is to use cookies; however, _storing_ cookies is not on by
     default.

`--load-cookies FILE'
     Load cookies from FILE before the first HTTP retrieval.  FILE is a
     textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
     `cookies.txt' file.

     You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
     require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
     content.  The login process typically works by the web server
     issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
     credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
     accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

     Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
     browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved
     by `--load-cookies'--simply point Wget to the location of the
     `cookies.txt' file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
     would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
     cookie files in different locations:

    Netscape 4.x.
          The cookies are in `~/.netscape/cookies.txt'.

    Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
          Mozilla's cookie file is also named `cookies.txt', located
          somewhere under `~/.mozilla', in the directory of your
          profile.  The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
          `~/.mozilla/default/SOME-WEIRD-STRING/cookies.txt'.

    Internet Explorer.
          You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
          menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been
          tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work
          with earlier versions.

    Other browsers.
          If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
          `--load-cookies' will only work if you can locate or produce a
          cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.

     If you cannot use `--load-cookies', there might still be an
     alternative.  If your browser supports a "cookie manager", you can
     use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're
     mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and
     manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
     "official" cookie support:

          wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: NAME=VALUE"

`--save-cookies FILE'
     Save cookies to FILE before exiting.  This will not save cookies
     that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called "session
     cookies"), but also see `--keep-session-cookies'.

`--keep-session-cookies'
     When specified, causes `--save-cookies' to also save session
     cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are
     meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.
     Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to
     visit the home page before you can access some pages.  With this
     option, multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session
     as far as the site is concerned.

     Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
     cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's
     `--load-cookies' recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
     confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
     treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
     `--save-cookies' to preserve them again, you must use
     `--keep-session-cookies' again.

`--ignore-length'
     Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
     precise) send out bogus `Content-Length' headers, which makes Wget
     go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can
     spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again
     and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
     connection has closed on the very same byte.

     With this option, Wget will ignore the `Content-Length' header--as
     if it never existed.

`--header=HEADER-LINE'
     Send HEADER-LINE along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP
     request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must
     contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
     newlines.

     You may define more than one additional header by specifying
     `--header' more than once.

          wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
               --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

     Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
     previous user-defined headers.

     As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
     otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to
     connect to localhost, but to specify `foo.bar' in the `Host'
     header:

          wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/

     In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of `--header' caused
     sending of duplicate headers.

`--max-redirect=NUMBER'
     Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
     resource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than
     necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to allow
     more (or fewer), this is the option to use.

`--proxy-user=USER'
`--proxy-password=PASSWORD'
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for authentication
     on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the `basic'
     authentication scheme.

     Security considerations similar to those with `--http-password'
     pertain here as well.

`--referer=URL'
     Include `Referer: URL' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
     retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
     are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
     come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
     point to them.

`--save-headers'
     Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
     actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

`-U AGENT-STRING'
`--user-agent=AGENT-STRING'
     Identify as AGENT-STRING to the HTTP server.

     The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
     `User-Agent' header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
     software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
     protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as `Wget/VERSION',
     VERSION being the current version number of Wget.

     However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
     tailoring the output according to the `User-Agent'-supplied
     information.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has
     been abused by servers denying information to clients other than
     (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet
     Explorer.  This option allows you to change the `User-Agent' line
     issued by Wget.  Use of this option is discouraged, unless you
     really know what you are doing.

     Specifying empty user agent with `--user-agent=""' instructs Wget
     not to send the `User-Agent' header in HTTP requests.

`--post-data=STRING'
`--post-file=FILE'
     Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the
     specified data in the request body.  `--post-data' sends STRING as
     data, whereas `--post-file' sends the contents of FILE.  Other than
     that, they work in exactly the same way.

     Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data
     in advance.  Therefore the argument to `--post-file' must be a
     regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like `/dev/stdin'
     won't work.  It's not quite clear how to work around this
     limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although HTTP/1.1 introduces
     "chunked" transfer that doesn't require knowing the request length
     in advance, a client can't use chunked unless it knows it's
     talking to an HTTP/1.1 server.  And it can't know that until it
     receives a response, which in turn requires the request to have
     been completed - a chicken-and-egg problem.

     Note: if Wget is redirected after the POST request is completed, it
     will not send the POST data to the redirected URL.  This is because
     URLs that process POST often respond with a redirection to a
     regular page, which does not desire or accept POST.  It is not
     completely clear that this behavior is optimal; if it doesn't work
     out, it might be changed in the future.

     This example shows how to log to a server using POST and then
     proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
     to authorized users:

          # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
          wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
               --post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \
               http://server.com/auth.php

          # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
          wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
               -p http://server.com/interesting/article.php

     If the server is using session cookies to track user
     authentication, the above will not work because `--save-cookies'
     will not save them (and neither will browsers) and the
     `cookies.txt' file will be empty.  In that case use
     `--keep-session-cookies' along with `--save-cookies' to force
     saving of session cookies.

`--content-disposition'
     If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support
     for `Content-Disposition' headers is enabled. This can currently
     result in extra round-trips to the server for a `HEAD' request,
     and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not
     currently enabled by default.

     This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that
     use `Content-Disposition' headers to describe what the name of a
     downloaded file should be.

`--auth-no-challenge'
     If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication
     information (plaintext username and password) for all requests,
     just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.

     Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to
     support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP
     authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say,
     in addition to form-based authentication.

2.8 HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options
===========================

To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
an external SSL library, currently OpenSSL.  If Wget is compiled
without SSL support, none of these options are available.

`--secure-protocol=PROTOCOL'
     Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are `auto',
     `SSLv2', `SSLv3', and `TLSv1'.  If `auto' is used, the SSL library
     is given the liberty of choosing the appropriate protocol
     automatically, which is achieved by sending an SSLv2 greeting and
     announcing support for SSLv3 and TLSv1.  This is the default.

     Specifying `SSLv2', `SSLv3', or `TLSv1' forces the use of the
     corresponding protocol.  This is useful when talking to old and
     buggy SSL server implementations that make it hard for OpenSSL to
     choose the correct protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are
     quite rare.

`--no-check-certificate'
     Don't check the server certificate against the available
     certificate authorities.  Also don't require the URL host name to
     match the common name presented by the certificate.

     As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's certificate
     against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
     handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
     Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
     interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
     versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or
     otherwise invalid certificates.  This option forces an "insecure"
     mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors
     into warnings and allows you to proceed.

     If you encounter "certificate verification" errors or ones saying
     that "common name doesn't match requested host name", you can use
     this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the
     download.  _Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of
     the site's authenticity, or if you really don't care about the
     validity of its certificate._  It is almost always a bad idea not
     to check the certificates when transmitting confidential or
     important data.

`--certificate=FILE'
     Use the client certificate stored in FILE.  This is needed for
     servers that are configured to require certificates from the
     clients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is not
     required and this switch is optional.

`--certificate-type=TYPE'
     Specify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are
     `PEM' (assumed by default) and `DER', also known as `ASN1'.

`--private-key=FILE'
     Read the private key from FILE.  This allows you to provide the
     private key in a file separate from the certificate.

`--private-key-type=TYPE'
     Specify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are `PEM'
     (the default) and `DER'.

`--ca-certificate=FILE'
     Use FILE as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities
     ("CA") to verify the peers.  The certificates must be in PEM
     format.

     Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
     system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

`--ca-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.  Each
     file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a
     hash value derived from the certificate.  This is achieved by
     processing a certificate directory with the `c_rehash' utility
     supplied with OpenSSL.  Using `--ca-directory' is more efficient
     than `--ca-certificate' when many certificates are installed
     because it allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.

     Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
     system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

`--random-file=FILE'
     Use FILE as the source of random data for seeding the
     pseudo-random number generator on systems without `/dev/random'.

     On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of
     randomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD (see
     `--egd-file' below) or read from an external source specified by
     the user.  If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random
     data in `$RANDFILE' or, if that is unset, in `$HOME/.rnd'.  If
     none of those are available, it is likely that SSL encryption will
     not be usable.

     If you're getting the "Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling SSL."
     error, you should provide random data using some of the methods
     described above.

`--egd-file=FILE'
     Use FILE as the EGD socket.  EGD stands for "Entropy Gathering
     Daemon", a user-space program that collects data from various
     unpredictable system sources and makes it available to other
     programs that might need it.  Encryption software, such as the SSL
     library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed the
     random number generator used to produce cryptographically strong
     keys.

     OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using
     the `RAND_FILE' environment variable.  If this variable is unset,
     or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness,
     OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this
     option.

     If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup
     command is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not needed
     on modern Unix systems that support `/dev/random'.

2.9 FTP Options
===============

`--ftp-user=USER'
`--ftp-password=PASSWORD'
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an FTP server.
     Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password
     defaults to `-wget@', normally used for anonymous FTP.

     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (*note URL Format::).  Either method reveals your password to
     anyone who bothers to run `ps'.  To prevent the passwords from
     being seen, store them in `.wgetrc' or `.netrc', and make sure to
     protect those files from other users with `chmod'.  If the
     passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those
     files either--edit the files and delete them after Wget has
     started the download.

`--no-remove-listing'
     Don't remove the temporary `.listing' files generated by FTP
     retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
     listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
     useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
     easily check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to
     verify that a mirror you're running is complete).

     Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
     file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
     `.listing' a symbolic link to `/etc/passwd' or something and
     asking `root' to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on
     the options used, either Wget will refuse to write to `.listing',
     making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
     symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
     `.listing' file, or the listing will be written to a
     `.listing.NUMBER' file.

     Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, `root' should
     never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
     something as simple as linking `index.html' to `/etc/passwd' and
     asking `root' to run Wget with `-N' or `-r' so the file will be
     overwritten.

`--no-glob'
     Turn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
     special characters ("wildcards"), like `*', `?', `[' and `]' to
     retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once, like:

          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

     By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
     globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on
     or off permanently.

     You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
     your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
     which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only
     with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix `ls' output).

`--no-passive-ftp'
     Disable the use of the "passive" FTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP
     mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the
     data connection rather than the other way around.

     If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive
     and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and
     NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
     However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually
     works when passive FTP doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the
     case, use this option, or set `passive_ftp=off' in your init file.

`--retr-symlinks'
     Usually, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a symbolic
     link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.
     Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local
     filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless
     this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
     downloaded it anyway.

     When `--retr-symlinks' is specified, however, symbolic links are
     traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time,
     this option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to
     directories and recurse through them, but in the future it should
     be enhanced to do this.

     Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
     specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed
     to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always
     traversed in this case.

`--no-http-keep-alive'
     Turn off the "keep-alive" feature for HTTP downloads.  Normally,
     Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you
     download more than one document from the same server, they get
     transferred over the same TCP connection.  This saves time and at
     the same time reduces the load on the server.

     This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent
     (keep-alive) connections don't work for you, for example due to a
     server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope
     with the connections.

2.10 Recursive Retrieval Options
================================

`-r'
`--recursive'
     Turn on recursive retrieving.  *Note Recursive Download::, for more
     details.

`-l DEPTH'
`--level=DEPTH'
     Specify recursion maximum depth level DEPTH (*note Recursive
     Download::).  The default maximum depth is 5.

`--delete-after'
     This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
     _after_ having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
     pages through a proxy, e.g.:

          wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

     The `-r' option is to retrieve recursively, and `-nd' to not
     create directories.

     Note that `--delete-after' deletes files on the local machine.  It
     does not issue the `DELE' command to remote FTP sites, for
     instance.  Also note that when `--delete-after' is specified,
     `--convert-links' is ignored, so `.orig' files are simply not
     created in the first place.

`-k'
`--convert-links'
     After the download is complete, convert the links in the document
     to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only
     the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
     external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
     hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

     Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

        * The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
          changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

          Example: if the downloaded file `/foo/doc.html' links to
          `/bar/img.gif', also downloaded, then the link in `doc.html'
          will be modified to point to `../bar/img.gif'.  This kind of
          transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
          directories.

        * The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will
          be changed to include host name and absolute path of the
          location they point to.

          Example: if the downloaded file `/foo/doc.html' links to
          `/bar/img.gif' (or to `../bar/img.gif'), then the link in
          `doc.html' will be modified to point to
          `http://HOSTNAME/bar/img.gif'.

     Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file
     was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
     not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address
     rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former
     links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move
     the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

     Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which
     links have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by
     `-k' will be performed at the end of all the downloads.

`-K'
`--backup-converted'
     When converting a file, back up the original version with a `.orig'
     suffix.  Affects the behavior of `-N' (*note HTTP Time-Stamping
     Internals::).

`-m'
`--mirror'
     Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
     recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
     keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to `-r
     -N -l inf --no-remove-listing'.

`-p'
`--page-requisites'
     This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
     necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
     such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

     Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
     documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
     downloaded.  Using `-r' together with `-l' can help, but since
     Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
     documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
     missing their requisites.

     For instance, say document `1.html' contains an `<IMG>' tag
     referencing `1.gif' and an `<A>' tag pointing to external document
     `2.html'.  Say that `2.html' is similar but that its image is
     `2.gif' and it links to `3.html'.  Say this continues up to some
     arbitrarily high number.

     If one executes the command:

          wget -r -l 2 http://SITE/1.html

     then `1.html', `1.gif', `2.html', `2.gif', and `3.html' will be
     downloaded.  As you can see, `3.html' is without its requisite
     `3.gif' because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to
     2) away from `1.html' in order to determine where to stop the
     recursion.  However, with this command:

          wget -r -l 2 -p http://SITE/1.html

     all the above files _and_ `3.html''s requisite `3.gif' will be
     downloaded.  Similarly,

          wget -r -l 1 -p http://SITE/1.html

     will cause `1.html', `1.gif', `2.html', and `2.gif' to be
     downloaded.  One might think that:

          wget -r -l 0 -p http://SITE/1.html

     would download just `1.html' and `1.gif', but unfortunately this
     is not the case, because `-l 0' is equivalent to `-l inf'--that
     is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a
     handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a `-i'
     URL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
     `-r' and `-l':

          wget -p http://SITE/1.html

     Note that Wget will behave as if `-r' had been specified, but only
     that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links
     from that page to external documents will not be followed.
     Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even
     if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot
     displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options
     in addition to `-p':

          wget -E -H -k -K -p http://SITE/DOCUMENT

     To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
     external document link is any URL specified in an `<A>' tag, an
     `<AREA>' tag, or a `<LINK>' tag other than `<LINK
     REL="stylesheet">'.

`--strict-comments'
     Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to
     terminate comments at the first occurrence of `-->'.

     According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML
     "declarations".  Declaration is special markup that begins with
     `<!' and ends with `>', such as `<!DOCTYPE ...>', that may contain
     comments between a pair of `--' delimiters.  HTML comments are
     "empty declarations", SGML declarations without any non-comment
     text.  Therefore, `<!--foo-->' is a valid comment, and so is
     `<!--one-- --two-->', but `<!--1--2-->' is not.

     On the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments as
     anything other than text delimited with `<!--' and `-->', which is
     not quite the same.  For example, something like `<!------------>'
     works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a
     multiple of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until
     the next `--', which may be at the other end of the document.
     Because of this, many popular browsers completely ignore the
     specification and implement what users have come to expect:
     comments delimited with `<!--' and `-->'.

     Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
     resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
     browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant
     comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks
     of clients that implements "naive" comments, terminating each
     comment at the first occurrence of `-->'.

     If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
     option to turn it on.


File: wget.info,  Node: Recursive Accept/Reject Options,  Prev: Recursive Retrieval Options,  Up: Invoking

2.11 Recursive Accept/Reject Options
====================================

`-A ACCLIST --accept ACCLIST'
`-R REJLIST --reject REJLIST'
     Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
     accept or reject (*note Types of Files::). Note that if any of the
     wildcard characters, `*', `?', `[' or `]', appear in an element of
     ACCLIST or REJLIST, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a
     suffix.

`-D DOMAIN-LIST'
`--domains=DOMAIN-LIST'
     Set domains to be followed.  DOMAIN-LIST is a comma-separated list
     of domains.  Note that it does _not_ turn on `-H'.

`--exclude-domains DOMAIN-LIST'
     Specify the domains that are _not_ to be followed.  (*note
     Spanning Hosts::).

`--follow-ftp'
     Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget
     will ignore all the FTP links.

`--follow-tags=LIST'
     Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it
     considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
     retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
     considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
     comma-separated LIST with this option.

`--ignore-tags=LIST'
     This is the opposite of the `--follow-tags' option.  To skip
     certain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to
     download, specify them in a comma-separated LIST.

     In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single
     page and its requisites, using a command-line like:

          wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://SITE/DOCUMENT

     However, the author of this option came across a page with tags
     like `<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">' and came to the realization that
     specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One can't just tell
     Wget to ignore `<LINK>', because then stylesheets will not be
     downloaded.  Now the best bet for downloading a single page and
     its requisites is the dedicated `--page-requisites' option.

`--ignore-case'
     Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This influences
     the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing
     implemented when downloading from FTP sites.  For example, with
     this option, `-A *.txt' will match `file1.txt', but also
     `file2.TXT', `file3.TxT', and so on.

`-H'
`--span-hosts'
     Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving
     (*note Spanning Hosts::).

`-L'
`--relative'
     Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
     page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts
     (*note Relative Links::).

`-I LIST'
`--include-directories=LIST'
     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow
     when downloading (*note Directory-Based Limits::).  Elements of
     LIST may contain wildcards.

`-X LIST'
`--exclude-directories=LIST'
     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
     from download (*note Directory-Based Limits::).  Elements of LIST
     may contain wildcards.

`-np'

`--no-parent'
     Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
     recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that
     only the files _below_ a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.
     *Note Directory-Based Limits::, for more details.

3 Recursive Download
********************

GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP or
FTP server), following links and directory structure.  We refer to this
as to "recursive retrieval", or "recursion".

   With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML from the given
URL, documents, retrieving the files the HTML document was referring
to, through markup like `href', or `src'.  If the freshly downloaded
file is also of type `text/html' or `application/xhtml+xml', it will be
parsed and followed further.

   Recursive retrieval of HTTP and HTML content is "breadth-first".
This means that Wget first downloads the requested HTML document, then
the documents linked from that document, then the documents linked by
them, and so on.  In other words, Wget first downloads the documents at
depth 1, then those at depth 2, and so on until the specified maximum
depth.

   The maximum "depth" to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the `-l' option.  The default maximum depth is five layers.

   When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the
data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to
the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the `depth' parameter.
Unlike HTTP recursion, FTP recursion is performed depth-first.

   By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

   Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

   You should be warned that recursive downloads can overload the remote
servers.  Because of that, many administrators frown upon them and may
ban access from your site if they detect very fast downloads of big
amounts of content.  When downloading from Internet servers, consider
using the `-w' option to introduce a delay between accesses to the
server.  The download will take a while longer, but the server
administrator will not be alarmed by your rudeness.

   Of course, recursive download may cause problems on your machine.  If
left to run unchecked, it can easily fill up the disk.  If downloading
from local network, it can also take bandwidth on the system, as well as
consume memory and CPU.

   Try to specify the criteria that match the kind of download you are
trying to achieve.  If you want to download only one page, use
`--page-requisites' without any additional recursion.  If you want to
download things under one directory, use `-np' to avoid downloading
things from other directories.  If you want to download all the files
from one directory, use `-l 1' to make sure the recursion depth never
exceeds one.  *Note Following Links::, for more information about this.

   Recursive retrieval should be used with care.  Don't say you were not
warned.

*****************

When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve loads of
unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

   For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
`fly.srk.fer.hr', you will not want to download all the home pages that
happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

   Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.

* Menu:

* Spanning Hosts::         (Un)limiting retrieval based on host name.
* Types of Files::         Getting only certain files.
* Directory-Based Limits:: Getting only certain directories.
* Relative Links::         Follow relative links only.
* FTP Links::              Following FTP links.

4.1 Spanning Hosts
==================

Wget's recursive retrieval normally refuses to visit hosts different
than the one you specified on the command line.  This is a reasonable
default; without it, every retrieval would have the potential to turn
your Wget into a small version of google.

   However, visiting different hosts, or "host spanning," is sometimes
a useful option.  Maybe the images are served from a different server.
Maybe you're mirroring a site that consists of pages interlinked between
three servers.  Maybe the server has two equivalent names, and the HTML
pages refer to both interchangeably.

Span to any host--`-H'
     The `-H' option turns on host spanning, thus allowing Wget's
     recursive run to visit any host referenced by a link.  Unless
     sufficient recursion-limiting criteria are applied depth, these
     foreign hosts will typically link to yet more hosts, and so on
     until Wget ends up sucking up much more data than you have
     intended.

Limit spanning to certain domains--`-D'
     The `-D' option allows you to specify the domains that will be
     followed, thus limiting the recursion only to the hosts that
     belong to these domains.  Obviously, this makes sense only in
     conjunction with `-H'.  A typical example would be downloading the
     contents of `www.server.com', but allowing downloads from
     `images.server.com', etc.:

          wget -rH -Dserver.com http://www.server.com/

     You can specify more than one address by separating them with a
     comma, e.g. `-Ddomain1.com,domain2.com'.

Keep download off certain domains--`--exclude-domains'
     If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do
     it with `--exclude-domains', which accepts the same type of
     arguments of `-D', but will _exclude_ all the listed domains.  For
     example, if you want to download all the hosts from `foo.edu'
     domain, with the exception of `sunsite.foo.edu', you can do it like
     this:

          wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu \
              http://www.foo.edu/

4.2 Types of Files
==================

When downloading material from the web, you will often want to restrict
the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you are
interested in downloading GIFs, you will not be overjoyed to get loads
of PostScript documents, and vice versa.

   Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in `.wgetrc'.

`-A ACCLIST'
`--accept ACCLIST'
`accept = ACCLIST'
     The argument to `--accept' option is a list of file suffixes or
     patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A
     suffix is the ending part of a file, and consists of "normal"
     letters, e.g. `gif' or `.jpg'.  A matching pattern contains
     shell-like wildcards, e.g. `books*' or `zelazny*196[0-9]*'.

     So, specifying `wget -A gif,jpg' will make Wget download only the
     files ending with `gif' or `jpg', i.e. GIFs and JPEGs.  On the
     other hand, `wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"' will download only files
     beginning with `zelazny' and containing numbers from 1960 to 1969
     anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for a
     description of how pattern matching works.

     Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined
     into a comma-separated list, and given as an argument to `-A'.

`-R REJLIST'
`--reject REJLIST'
`reject = REJLIST'
     The `--reject' option works the same way as `--accept', only its
     logic is the reverse; Wget will download all files _except_ the
     ones matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

     So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
     MPEGs and .AU files, you can use `wget -R mpg,mpeg,au'.
     Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
     `bjork', use `wget -R "bjork*"'.  The quotes are to prevent
     expansion by the shell.

The `-A' and `-R' options may be combined to achieve even better
fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. `wget -A "*zelazny*" -R
.ps' will download all the files having `zelazny' as a part of their
name, but _not_ the PostScript files.

   Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
files (as determined by a `.htm' or `.html' filename prefix). This
behavior may not be desirable for all users, and may be changed for
future versions of Wget.

   Note, too, that query strings (strings at the end of a URL beginning
with a question mark (`?') are not included as part of the filename for
accept/reject rules, even though these will actually contribute to the
name chosen for the local file. It is expected that a future version of
Wget will provide an option to allow matching against query strings.

   Finally, it's worth noting that the accept/reject lists are matched
_twice_ against downloaded files: once against the URL's filename
portion, to determine if the file should be downloaded in the first
place; then, after it has been accepted and successfully downloaded,
the local file's name is also checked against the accept/reject lists
to see if it should be removed. The rationale was that, since `.htm'
and `.html' files are always downloaded regardless of accept/reject
rules, they should be removed _after_ being downloaded and scanned for
links, if they did match the accept/reject lists. However, this can
lead to unexpected results, since the local filenames can differ from
the original URL filenames in the following ways, all of which can
change whether an accept/reject rule matches:

   * If the local file already exists and `--no-directories' was
     specified, a numeric suffix will be appended to the original name.

   * If `--html-extension' was specified, the local filename will have
     `.html' appended to it. If Wget is invoked with `-E -A.php', a
     filename such as `index.php' will match be accepted, but upon
     download will be named `index.php.html', which no longer matches,
     and so the file will be deleted.

   * Query strings do not contribute to URL matching, but are included
     in local filenames, and so _do_ contribute to filename matching.

This behavior, too, is considered less-than-desirable, and may change
in a future version of Wget.


File: wget.info,  Node: Directory-Based Limits,  Next: Relative Links,  Prev: Types of Files,  Up: Following Links

4.3 Directory-Based Limits
==========================

Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this--the
home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g. `/cgi-bin' or `/dev'
directories.

   Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.
Each option description lists a short name, a long name, and the
equivalent command in `.wgetrc'.

`-I LIST'
`--include LIST'
`include_directories = LIST'
     `-I' option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
     in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.
     The directories are absolute paths.

     So, if you wish to download from `http://host/people/bozo/'
     following only links to bozo's colleagues in the `/people'
     directory and the bogus scripts in `/cgi-bin', you can specify:

          wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/

`-X LIST'
`--exclude LIST'
`exclude_directories = LIST'
     `-X' option is exactly the reverse of `-I'--this is a list of
     directories _excluded_ from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
     Wget to download things from `/cgi-bin' directory, specify `-X
     /cgi-bin' on the command line.

     The same as with `-A'/`-R', these two options can be combined to
     get a better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if
     you want to load all the files from `/pub' hierarchy except for
     `/pub/worthless', specify `-I/pub -X/pub/worthless'.

`-np'
`--no-parent'
`no_parent = on'
     The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
     disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
     "above" than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent to
     the parent directory/directories.

     The `--no-parent' option (short `-np') is useful in this case.
     Using it guarantees that you will never leave the existing
     hierarchy.  Supposing you issue Wget with:

          wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/

     You may rest assured that none of the references to
     `/~his-girls-homepage/' or `/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/' will be
     followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be
     downloaded.  Essentially, `--no-parent' is similar to
     `-I/~luzer/my-archive', only it handles redirections in a more
     intelligent fashion.

     *Note* that, for HTTP (and HTTPS), the trailing slash is very
     important to `--no-parent'. HTTP has no concept of a
     "directory"--Wget relies on you to indicate what's a directory and
     what isn't. In `http://foo/bar/', Wget will consider `bar' to be a
     directory, while in `http://foo/bar' (no trailing slash), `bar'
     will be considered a filename (so `--no-parent' would be
     meaningless, as its parent is `/').


File: wget.info,  Node: Relative Links,  Next: FTP Links,  Prev: Directory-Based Limits,  Up: Following Links

4.4 Relative Links
==================

When `-L' is turned on, only the relative links are ever followed.
Relative links are here defined those that do not refer to the web
server root.  For example, these links are relative:

     <a href="foo.gif">
     <a href="foo/bar.gif">
     <a href="../foo/bar.gif">

   These links are not relative:

     <a href="/foo.gif">
     <a href="/foo/bar.gif">
     <a href="http://www.server.com/foo/bar.gif">

   Using this option guarantees that recursive retrieval will not span
hosts, even without `-H'.  In simple cases it also allows downloads to
"just work" without having to convert links.

   This option is probably not very useful and might be removed in a
future release.


File: wget.info,  Node: FTP Links,  Prev: Relative Links,  Up: Following Links

4.5 Following FTP Links
=======================

The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for them to
be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included for purposes of
reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them by default.

   To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to specify
the `--follow-ftp' option.  Having done that, FTP links will span hosts
regardless of `-H' setting.  This is logical, as FTP links rarely point
to the same host where the HTTP server resides.  For similar reasons,
the `-L' options has no effect on such downloads.  On the other hand,
domain acceptance (`-D') and suffix rules (`-A' and `-R') apply
normally.

   Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

5 Time-Stamping
***************

One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

   Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

   Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of "new" files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in the
place of the old ones.

   A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

  1. A file of that name does not already exist locally.

  2. A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified
     more recently than the local file.

   To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both local and remote files.  We call this information
the "time-stamp" of a file.

   The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using `--timestamping'
(`-N') option, or through `timestamping = on' directive in `.wgetrc'.
With this option, for each file it intends to download, Wget will check
whether a local file of the same name exists.  If it does, and the
remote file is older, Wget will not download it.

   If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

* FTP Time-Stamping Internals::


File: wget.info,  Node: Time-Stamping Usage,  Next: HTTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Up: Time-Stamping

5.1 Time-Stamping Usage
=======================

The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to download a
file so that it keeps its date of modification.

     wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   A simple `ls -l' shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the `Last-Modified' header, as returned by the server.  As
you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even without
`-N' (at least for HTTP).

   Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file
has changed, and download it if it has.

     wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local
file has the same timestamp as the server, or a newer one, the remote
file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the remote file is more
recent, Wget will proceed to fetch it.

   The same goes for FTP.  For example:

     wget "ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*"

   (The quotes around that URL are to prevent the shell from trying to
interpret the `*'.)

   After download, a local directory listing will show that the
timestamps match those on the remote server.  Reissuing the command
with `-N' will make Wget re-fetch _only_ the files that have been
modified since the last download.

   If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use a
command like the following, weekly:

     wget --timestamping -r ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/

   Note that time-stamping will only work for files for which the server
gives a timestamp.  For HTTP, this depends on getting a `Last-Modified'
header.  For FTP, this depends on getting a directory listing with
dates in a format that Wget can parse (*note FTP Time-Stamping
Internals::).


File: wget.info,  Node: HTTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Next: FTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Prev: Time-Stamping Usage,  Up: Time-Stamping

5.2 HTTP Time-Stamping Internals
================================

Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the `Last-Modified'
header.  If you wish to retrieve the file `foo.html' through HTTP, Wget
will check whether `foo.html' exists locally.  If it doesn't,
`foo.html' will be retrieved unconditionally.

   If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way `ls -l' checks it), and then send a
`HEAD' request to the remote server, demanding the information on the
remote file.

   The `Last-Modified' header is examined to find which file was
modified more recently (which makes it "newer").  If the remote file is
newer, it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give up.(1)

   When `--backup-converted' (`-K') is specified in conjunction with
`-N', server file `X' is compared to local file `X.orig', if extant,
rather than being compared to local file `X', which will always differ
if it's been converted by `--convert-links' (`-k').

   Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
`If-Modified-Since' request.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As an additional check, Wget will look at the `Content-Length'
header, and compare the sizes; if they are not the same, the remote
file will be downloaded no matter what the time-stamp says.


File: wget.info,  Node: FTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Prev: HTTP Time-Stamping Internals,  Up: Time-Stamping

5.3 FTP Time-Stamping Internals
===============================

In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only FTP has
no headers--time-stamps must be ferreted out of directory listings.

   If an FTP download is recursive or uses globbing, Wget will use the
FTP `LIST' command to get a file listing for the directory containing
the desired file(s).  It will try to analyze the listing, treating it
like Unix `ls -l' output, extracting the time-stamps.  The rest is
exactly the same as for HTTP.  Note that when retrieving individual
files from an FTP server without using globbing or recursion, listing
files will not be downloaded (and thus files will not be time-stamped)
unless `-N' is specified.

   Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most (all?)
of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959 defines no
standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.  We can
only hope that a future standard will define this.

   Another non-standard solution includes the use of `MDTM' command
that is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular
`wu-ftpd'), which returns the exact time of the specified file.  Wget
may support this command in the future.

6 Startup File
**************

Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
file--`.wgetrc'.

   Besides `.wgetrc' is the "main" initialization file, it is
convenient to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget
reads and interprets the contents of `$HOME/.netrc', if it finds it.
You can find `.netrc' format in your system manuals.

   Wget reads `.wgetrc' upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
commands.

* Wgetrc Syntax::     Syntax of wgetrc.
* Wgetrc Commands::   List of available commands.
* Sample Wgetrc::     A wgetrc example.


File: wget.info,  Node: Wgetrc Location,  Next: Wgetrc Syntax,  Up: Startup File

6.1 Wgetrc Location
===================

When initializing, Wget will look for a "global" startup file,
`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default (or some prefix other than
`/usr/local', if Wget was not installed there) and read commands from
there, if it exists.

   Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
`WGETRC' is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

   If `WGETRC' is not set, Wget will try to load `$HOME/.wgetrc'.

   The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision user's wgetrc _overrides_ the
system-wide wgetrc (in `/usr/local/etc/wgetrc' by default).  Fascist
admins, away!


File: wget.info,  Node: Wgetrc Syntax,  Next: Wgetrc Commands,  Prev: Wgetrc Location,  Up: Startup File

6.2 Wgetrc Syntax
=================

The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:

     variable = value

   The "variable" will also be called "command".  Valid "values" are
different for different commands.

   The commands are case-insensitive and underscore-insensitive.  Thus
`DIr__PrefiX' is the same as `dirprefix'.  Empty lines, lines beginning
with `#' and lines containing white-space only are discarded.

   Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
global `wgetrc', you can do it with:

     reject =

6.3 Wgetrc Commands
===================

The complete set of commands is listed below.  Legal values are listed
after the `='.  Simple Boolean values can be set or unset using `on'
and `off' or `1' and `0'.

   Some commands take pseudo-arbitrary values.  ADDRESS values can be
hostnames or dotted-quad IP addresses.  N can be any positive integer,
or `inf' for infinity, where appropriate.  STRING values can be any
non-empty string.

   Most of these commands have direct command-line equivalents.  Also,
any wgetrc command can be specified on the command line using the
`--execute' switch (*note Basic Startup Options::.)

accept/reject = STRING
     Same as `-A'/`-R' (*note Types of Files::).

add_hostdir = on/off
     Enable/disable host-prefixed file names.  `-nH' disables it.

background = on/off
     Enable/disable going to background--the same as `-b' (which
     enables it).

backup_converted = on/off
     Enable/disable saving pre-converted files with the suffix
     `.orig'--the same as `-K' (which enables it).

base = STRING
     Consider relative URLs in URL input files forced to be interpreted
     as HTML as being relative to STRING--the same as `--base=STRING'.

bind_address = ADDRESS
     Bind to ADDRESS, like the `--bind-address=ADDRESS'.

ca_certificate = FILE
     Set the certificate authority bundle file to FILE.  The same as
     `--ca-certificate=FILE'.

ca_directory = DIRECTORY
     Set the directory used for certificate authorities.  The same as
     `--ca-directory=DIRECTORY'.

cache = on/off
     When set to off, disallow server-caching.  See the `--no-cache'
     option.

certificate = FILE
     Set the client certificate file name to FILE.  The same as
     `--certificate=FILE'.

certificate_type = STRING
     Specify the type of the client certificate, legal values being
     `PEM' (the default) and `DER' (aka ASN1).  The same as
     `--certificate-type=STRING'.

check_certificate = on/off
     If this is set to off, the server certificate is not checked
     against the specified client authorities.  The default is "on".
     The same as `--check-certificate'.

connect_timeout = N
     Set the connect timeout--the same as `--connect-timeout'.

content_disposition = on/off
     Turn on recognition of the (non-standard) `Content-Disposition'
     HTTP header--if set to `on', the same as `--content-disposition'.

continue = on/off
     If set to on, force continuation of preexistent partially retrieved
     files.  See `-c' before setting it.

convert_links = on/off
     Convert non-relative links locally.  The same as `-k'.

cookies = on/off
     When set to off, disallow cookies.  See the `--cookies' option.

cut_dirs = N
     Ignore N remote directory components.  Equivalent to
     `--cut-dirs=N'.

debug = on/off
     Debug mode, same as `-d'.

delete_after = on/off
     Delete after download--the same as `--delete-after'.

dir_prefix = STRING
     Top of directory tree--the same as `-P STRING'.

dirstruct = on/off
     Turning dirstruct on or off--the same as `-x' or `-nd',
     respectively.

dns_cache = on/off
     Turn DNS caching on/off.  Since DNS caching is on by default, this
     option is normally used to turn it off and is equivalent to
     `--no-dns-cache'.

dns_timeout = N
     Set the DNS timeout--the same as `--dns-timeout'.

domains = STRING
     Same as `-D' (*note Spanning Hosts::).

dot_bytes = N
     Specify the number of bytes "contained" in a dot, as seen
     throughout the retrieval (1024 by default).  You can postfix the
     value with `k' or `m', representing kilobytes and megabytes,
     respectively.  With dot settings you can tailor the dot retrieval
     to suit your needs, or you can use the predefined "styles" (*note
     Download Options::).

dot_spacing = N
     Specify the number of dots in a single cluster (10 by default).

dots_in_line = N
     Specify the number of dots that will be printed in each line
     throughout the retrieval (50 by default).

     Use STRING as the EGD socket file name.  The same as
     `--egd-file=FILE'.

exclude_directories = STRING
     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
     from download--the same as `-X STRING' (*note Directory-Based
     Limits::).

     Only follow certain HTML tags when doing a recursive retrieval,
     just like `--follow-tags=STRING'.

force_html = on/off
     If set to on, force the input filename to be regarded as an HTML
     document--the same as `-F'.

ftp_password = STRING
     Set your FTP password to STRING.  Without this setting, the
     password defaults to `-wget@', which is a useful default for
     anonymous FTP access.

     This command used to be named `passwd' prior to Wget 1.10.

ftp_proxy = STRING
     Use STRING as FTP proxy, instead of the one specified in
     environment.

ftp_user = STRING
     Set FTP user to STRING.

     This command used to be named `login' prior to Wget 1.10.

glob = on/off
     Turn globbing on/off--the same as `--glob' and `--no-glob'.

header = STRING
     Define a header for HTTP downloads, like using `--header=STRING'.

html_extension = on/off

     retrieving after the download sum has become greater than quota.
     The quota can be specified in bytes (default), kbytes `k'
     appended) or mbytes (`m' appended).  Thus `quota = 5m' will set
     the quota to 5 megabytes.  Note that the user's startup file
     overrides system settings.

     Follow only relative links--the same as `-L' (*note Relative
     Links::).

remove_listing = on/off
     If set to on, remove FTP listings downloaded by Wget.  Setting it
     to off is the same as `--no-remove-listing'.

     When set to on, consider "connection refused" a transient
     error--the same as `--retry-connrefused'.

robots = on/off
     Specify whether the norobots convention is respected by Wget, "on"
     by default.  This switch controls both the `/robots.txt' and the

     Set all applicable timeout values to N, the same as `-T N'.

timestamping = on/off
     Turn timestamping on/off.  The same as `-N' (*note
     Time-Stamping::).

tries = N
     Set number of retries per URL--the same as `-t N'.

use_proxy = on/off
     When set to off, don't use proxy even when proxy-related
     environment variables are set.  In that case it is the same as
     using `--no-proxy'.

user = STRING
     Specify username STRING for both FTP and HTTP file retrieval.
     This command can be overridden using the `ftp_user' and
     `http_user' command for FTP and HTTP respectively.

6.4 Sample Wgetrc
=================

This is the sample initialization file, as given in the distribution.
It is divided in two section--one for global usage (suitable for global
startup file), and one for local usage (suitable for `$HOME/.wgetrc').
Be careful about the things you change.

   Note that almost all the lines are commented out.  For a command to
have any effect, you must remove the `#' character at the beginning of
its line.

     ###
     ### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc
     ###

     ## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
     ## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
     ## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
     ## to find out what you can put into this file.
     ##
     ## Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
     ## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
     ##
     ## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
     ## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
     ## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").


     ##
     ## Global settings (useful for setting up in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc).
     ## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
     ## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
     ##

     # You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
     # optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
     # default quota is unlimited.
     #quota = inf

     # You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
     # downloading a file (default is 20).
     #tries = 20

     # Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
     # prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
     # the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
     #reclevel = 5

     # By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
     # initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
     # way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
     # computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
     # firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
     # problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
     # environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
     #passive_ftp = off

     # The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
     # If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
     # downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
     # will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
     # on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
     waitretry = 10


     ##
     ## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
     ## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
     ## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
     ##
     ## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
     ## are doing before doing so.
     ##

     # Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
     #timestamping = off

     # It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
     # header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
     # you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
     #header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>

     # You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
     # is *not* sent by default.
     #header = Accept-Language: en

     # You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http and ftp.
     # They will override the value in the environment.
     #http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

     # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
     #use_proxy = on

     # You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
     # binary, mega and micro.
     #dot_style = default

     # Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
     # know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
     # the default!
     #robots = on

     # It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
     # the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
     #wait = 0

     # You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
     # retrieved, by setting this to on.
     #dirstruct = off

     # You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
     # you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
     #recursive = off

     # To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
     # to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
     # set this variable to on:
     #backup_converted = off

     # To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this

7 Examples
**********

The examples are divided into three sections loosely based on their
complexity.

* Menu:

* Simple Usage::         Simple, basic usage of the program.
* Advanced Usage::       Advanced tips.
* Very Advanced Usage::  The hairy stuff.


File: wget.info,  Node: Simple Usage,  Next: Advanced Usage,  Up: Examples

7.1 Simple Usage
================

   * Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:

          wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

   * But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is
     lengthy?  The connection will probably fail before the whole file
     is retrieved, more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting
     the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
     default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy to change
     the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will
     arrive safely:

          wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg

   * Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its
     progress to log file `log'.  It is tiring to type `--tries', so we
     shall use `-t'.

          wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &

     The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in
     the background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use `-t inf'.

   * The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
     password.

          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg

   * If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory
     listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:

          wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
          links index.html


File: wget.info,  Node: Advanced Usage,  Next: Very Advanced Usage,  Prev: Simple Usage,  Up: Examples

7.2 Advanced Usage
==================

   * You have a file that contains the URLs you want to download?  Use
     the `-i' switch:

          wget -i FILE

     If you specify `-' as file name, the URLs will be read from
     standard input.

   * Create a five levels deep mirror image of the GNU web site, with
     the same directory structure the original has, with only one try
     per document, saving the log of the activities to `gnulog':

          wget -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog

   * The same as the above, but convert the links in the HTML files to
     point to local files, so you can view the documents off-line:

          wget --convert-links -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog

   * Retrieve only one HTML page, but make sure that all the elements
     needed for the page to be displayed, such as inline images and
     external style sheets, are also downloaded.  Also make sure the
     downloaded page references the downloaded links.

          wget -p --convert-links http://www.server.com/dir/page.html

     The HTML page will be saved to `www.server.com/dir/page.html', and
     the images, stylesheets, etc., somewhere under `www.server.com/',
     depending on where they were on the remote server.

   * The same as the above, but without the `www.server.com/' directory.
     In fact, I don't want to have all those random server directories
     anyway--just save _all_ those files under a `download/'
     subdirectory of the current directory.

          wget -p --convert-links -nH -nd -Pdownload \
               http://www.server.com/dir/page.html

   * Retrieve the index.html of `www.lycos.com', showing the original
     server headers:

          wget -S http://www.lycos.com/

   * Save the server headers with the file, perhaps for post-processing.

          wget --save-headers http://www.lycos.com/
          more index.html

   * Retrieve the first two levels of `wuarchive.wustl.edu', saving them
     to `/tmp'.

          wget -r -l2 -P/tmp ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/

   * You want to download all the GIFs from a directory on an HTTP
     server.  You tried `wget http://www.server.com/dir/*.gif', but that
     didn't work because HTTP retrieval does not support globbing.  In
     that case, use:

          wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/

     More verbose, but the effect is the same.  `-r -l1' means to
     retrieve recursively (*note Recursive Download::), with maximum
     depth of 1.  `--no-parent' means that references to the parent
     directory are ignored (*note Directory-Based Limits::), and
     `-A.gif' means to download only the GIF files.  `-A "*.gif"' would
     have worked too.

   * Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
     interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already
     present.  It would be:

          wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.org/

   * If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
     FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (*note URL Format::).

          wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.server.com/.emacs

     Note, however, that this usage is not advisable on multi-user
     systems because it reveals your password to anyone who looks at
     the output of `ps'.

   * You would like the output documents to go to standard output
     instead of to files?

          wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/

     You can also combine the two options and make pipelines to
     retrieve the documents from remote hotlists:

          wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -


File: wget.info,  Node: Very Advanced Usage,  Prev: Advanced Usage,  Up: Examples

7.3 Very Advanced Usage
=======================

   * If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
     subdirectories), use `--mirror' (`-m'), which is the shorthand for
     `-r -l inf -N'.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to
     recheck a site each Sunday:

          crontab
          0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

   * In addition to the above, you want the links to be converted for
     local viewing.  But, after having read this manual, you know that
     link conversion doesn't play well with timestamping, so you also
     want Wget to back up the original HTML files before the
     conversion.  Wget invocation would look like this:

          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted  \
               http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

   * But you've also noticed that local viewing doesn't work all that
     well when HTML files are saved under extensions other than `.html',
     perhaps because they were served as `index.cgi'.  So you'd like
     Wget to rename all the files served with content-type `text/html'
     or `application/xhtml+xml' to `NAME.html'.

          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted \
               --html-extension -o /home/me/weeklog        \
               http://www.gnu.org/

     Or, with less typing:

          wget -m -k -K -E http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

8.1 Proxies
===========

"Proxies" are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer data
from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies is
lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy
which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is requested
again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for proxies
is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal
networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain information
from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data using an
authorized proxy.

   Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
the following environment variables:

`http_proxy'
`https_proxy'
     If set, the `http_proxy' and `https_proxy' variables should
     contain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS connections
     respectively.

`ftp_proxy'
     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP
     connections.  It is quite common that `http_proxy' and `ftp_proxy'
     are set to the same URL.

`no_proxy'
     This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
     extensions proxy should _not_ be used for.  For instance, if the
     value of `no_proxy' is `.mit.edu', proxy will not be used to
     retrieve documents from MIT.

   In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.

`--no-proxy'
`proxy = on/off'
     This option and the corresponding command may be used to suppress
     the use of proxy, even if the appropriate environment variables
     are set.

`http_proxy = URL'
`https_proxy = URL'
`ftp_proxy = URL'
`no_proxy = STRING'
     These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy
     settings specified by the environment.

   Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.
The authorization consists of "username" and "password", which must be
sent by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several authentication
schemes exist.  For proxy authorization only the `Basic' authentication
scheme is currently implemented.

   You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the company's
proxy is located at `proxy.company.com' at port 8001, a proxy URL
location containing authorization data might look like this:

     http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/

   Alternatively, you may use the `proxy-user' and `proxy-password'
options, and the equivalent `.wgetrc' settings `proxy_user' and
`proxy_password' to set the proxy username and password.

8.3 Web Site
============

The official web site for GNU Wget is at
`http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/'. However, most useful information
resides at "The Wget Wgiki", `http://wget.addictivecode.org/'.

8.4 Mailing List
================

There are several Wget-related mailing lists.  The general discussion
list is at <wget@sunsite.dk>.  It is the preferred place for support
requests and suggestions, as well as for discussion of development.
You are invited to subscribe.

   To subscribe, simply send mail to <wget-subscribe@sunsite.dk> and
follow the instructions.  Unsubscribe by mailing to
<wget-unsubscribe@sunsite.dk>.  The mailing list is archived at
`http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/' and at
`http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general'.

   Another mailing list is at <wget-patches@sunsite.dk>, and is used to
submit patches for review by Wget developers.  A "patch" is a textual
representation of change to source code, readable by both humans and
programs.  The `http://wget.addictivecode.org/PatchGuidelines' page
covers the creation and submitting of patches in detail.  Please don't
send general suggestions or bug reports to `wget-patches'; use it only
for patch submissions.

   Subscription is the same as above for <wget@sunsite.dk>, except that
you send to <wget-patches-subscribe@sunsite.dk>, instead.  The mailing
list is archived at `http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.patches'.

   Finally, there is the <wget-notify@addictivecode.org> mailing list.
This is a non-discussion list that receives commit notifications from
the source repository, and also bug report-change notifications.  This
is the highest-traffic list for Wget, and is recommended only for
people who are seriously interested in ongoing Wget development.
Subscription is through the `mailman' interface at
`http://addictivecode.org/mailman/listinfo/wget-notify'.

8.6 Reporting Bugs
==================

You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug tracker (see
`http://wget.addictivecode.org/BugTracker').

   Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

  1. Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.
     If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as
     documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
     sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
     bug, but you might want to double-check the documentation and the
     mailing lists (*note Mailing List::).

  2. Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.
     E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading `wget -rl0 -kKE -t5
     --no-proxy http://yoyodyne.com -o /tmp/log', you should try to see
     if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set
     of options.  You might even try to start the download at the page
     where the crash occurred to see if that page somehow triggered the
     crash.

     Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of
     your `.wgetrc' file, just dumping it into the debug message is
     probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the
     bug repeats with `.wgetrc' moved out of the way.  Only if it turns
     out that `.wgetrc' settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant
     parts of the file.

  3. Please start Wget with `-d' option and send us the resulting
     output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without
     debug support, recompile it--it is _much_ easier to trace bugs
     with debug support on.

     Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive
     information from the debug log before sending it to the bug
     address.  The `-d' won't go out of its way to collect sensitive
     information, but the log _will_ contain a fairly complete
     transcript of Wget's communication with the server, which may
     include passwords and pieces of downloaded data.  Since the bug
     address is publically archived, you may assume that all bug
     reports are visible to the public.

  4. If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. `gdb `which
     wget` core' and type `where' to get the backtrace.  This may not
     work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is
     safe to try.

8.7 Portability
===============

Like all GNU software, Wget works on the GNU system.  However, since it
uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and mostly avoids using
"special" features of any particular Unix, it should compile (and work)
on all common Unix flavors.

   Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds
of Unix systems, including GNU/Linux, Solaris, SunOS 4.x, Mac OS X, OSF
(aka Digital Unix or Tru64), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, AIX, and others.  Some
of those systems are no longer in widespread use and may not be able to
support recent versions of Wget.  If Wget fails to compile on your
system, we would like to know about it.

   Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
on 32-bit Microsoft Windows platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 6.0, Watcom, Borland C, and GCC
compilers.  Naturally, it is crippled of some features available on
Unix, but it should work as a substitute for people stuck with Windows.
Note that Windows-specific portions of Wget are not guaranteed to be
supported in the future, although this has been the case in practice
for many years now.  All questions and problems in Windows usage should
be reported to Wget mailing list at <wget@sunsite.dk> where the
volunteers who maintain the Windows-related features might look at them.

   Support for building on MS-DOS via DJGPP has been contributed by
Gisle Vanem; a port to VMS is maintained by Steven Schweda, and is
available at `http://antinode.org/'.

8.8 Signals
===========

Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (`SIGHUP') and ignores it.  If the output was on standard
output, it will be redirected to a file named `wget-log'.  Otherwise,
`SIGHUP' is ignored.  This is convenient when you wish to redirect the
output of Wget after having started it.

     $ wget http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz &
     ...
     $ kill -HUP %%
     SIGHUP received, redirecting output to `wget-log'.

   Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
way.  `C-c', `kill -TERM' and `kill -KILL' should kill it alike.

9.1 Robot Exclusion
===================

It is extremely easy to make Wget wander aimlessly around a web site,
sucking all the available data in progress.  `wget -r SITE', and you're
set.  Great?  Not for the server admin.

   As long as Wget is only retrieving static pages, and doing it at a
reasonable rate (see the `--wait' option), there's not much of a
problem.  The trouble is that Wget can't tell the difference between the
smallest static page and the most demanding CGI.  A site I know has a
section handled by a CGI Perl script that converts Info files to HTML on
the fly.  The script is slow, but works well enough for human users
viewing an occasional Info file.  However, when someone's recursive Wget
download stumbles upon the index page that links to all the Info files
through the script, the system is brought to its knees without providing
anything useful to the user (This task of converting Info files could be
done locally and access to Info documentation for all installed GNU
software on a system is available from the `info' command).

   To avoid this kind of accident, as well as to preserve privacy for
documents that need to be protected from well-behaved robots, the
concept of "robot exclusion" was invented.  The idea is that the server
administrators and document authors can specify which portions of the
site they wish to protect from robots and those they will permit access.

   The most popular mechanism, and the de facto standard supported by
all the major robots, is the "Robots Exclusion Standard" (RES) written
by Martijn Koster et al. in 1994.  It specifies the format of a text
file containing directives that instruct the robots which URL paths to
avoid.  To be found by the robots, the specifications must be placed in
`/robots.txt' in the server root, which the robots are expected to
download and parse.

   Although Wget is not a web robot in the strictest sense of the word,
it can downloads large parts of the site without the user's
intervention to download an individual page.  Because of that, Wget
honors RES when downloading recursively.  For instance, when you issue:

     wget -r http://www.server.com/

   First the index of `www.server.com' will be downloaded.  If Wget
finds that it wants to download more documents from that server, it will
request `http://www.server.com/robots.txt' and, if found, use it for
further downloads.  `robots.txt' is loaded only once per each server.

   Until version 1.8, Wget supported the first version of the standard,
written by Martijn Koster in 1994 and available at
`http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html'.  As of version 1.8, Wget
has supported the additional directives specified in the internet draft
`<draft-koster-robots-00.txt>' titled "A Method for Web Robots
Control".  The draft, which has as far as I know never made to an RFC,
is available at `http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.txt'.

   This manual no longer includes the text of the Robot Exclusion
Standard.

   The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual
document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be
followed by a robot.  This is achieved using the `META' tag, like this:

     <meta name="robots" content="nofollow">

   This is explained in some detail at
`http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html'.  Wget supports this
method of robot exclusion in addition to the usual `/robots.txt'
exclusion.

   If you know what you are doing and really really wish to turn off the
robot exclusion, set the `robots' variable to `off' in your `.wgetrc'.
You can achieve the same effect from the command line using the `-e'
switch, e.g. `wget -e robots=off URL...'.


File: wget.info,  Node: Security Considerations,  Next: Contributors,  Prev: Robot Exclusion,  Up: Appendices

9.2 Security Considerations
===========================

When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted passwords
through the network, which may present a security problem.  Here are the
main issues, and some solutions.

  1. The passwords on the command line are visible using `ps'.  The best
     way around it is to use `wget -i -' and feed the URLs to Wget's
     standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by `C-d'.
     Another workaround is to use `.netrc' to store passwords; however,
     storing unencrypted passwords is also considered a security risk.

  2. Using the insecure "basic" authentication scheme, unencrypted
     passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

  3. The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
     solution for this at the moment.

  4. Although the "normal" output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
     debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
     being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send
     them to me).

9.3 Contributors
================

GNU Wget was written by Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org>, and it is
currently maintained by Micah Cowan <micah@cowan.name>.

However, the development of Wget could never have gone as far as it
has, were it not for the help of many people, either with bug reports,
feature proposals, patches, or letters saying "Thanks!".

   Special thanks goes to the following people (no particular order):

   * Dan Harkless--contributed a lot of code and documentation of
     extremely high quality, as well as the `--page-requisites' and
     related options.  He was the principal maintainer for some time and
     released Wget 1.6.

   * Ian Abbott--contributed bug fixes, Windows-related fixes, and
     provided a prototype implementation of the breadth-first recursive
     download.  Co-maintained Wget during the 1.8 release cycle.

   * The dotsrc.org crew, in particular Karsten Thygesen--donated system
     resources such as the mailing list, web space, FTP space, and
     version control repositories, along with a lot of time to make
     these actually work.  Christian Reiniger was of invaluable help
     with setting up Subversion.

   * Heiko Herold--provided high-quality Windows builds and contributed
     bug and build reports for many years.

   * Shawn McHorse--bug reports and patches.

   * Kaveh R. Ghazi--on-the-fly `ansi2knr'-ization.  Lots of
     portability fixes.

   * Gordon Matzigkeit--`.netrc' support.

   * Zlatko Calusic, Tomislav Vujec and Drazen Kacar--feature
     suggestions and "philosophical" discussions.

   * Darko Budor--initial port to Windows.

   * Antonio Rosella--help and suggestions, plus the initial Italian
     translation.

   * Tomislav Petrovic, Mario Mikocevic--many bug reports and
     suggestions.

   * Francois Pinard--many thorough bug reports and discussions.

   * Karl Eichwalder--lots of help with internationalization, Makefile
     layout and many other things.

   * Junio Hamano--donated support for Opie and HTTP `Digest'
     authentication.

   * Mauro Tortonesi--Improved IPv6 support, adding support for dual
     family systems.  Refactored and enhanced FTP IPv6 code. Maintained
     GNU Wget from 2004-2008.

   * Christopher G. Lewis--Maintenance of the Windows version of GNU
     WGet.

   * Gisle Vanem--Many helpful patches and improvements, especially for
     Windows and MS-DOS support.

   * People who provided donations for development--including Brian
     Gough.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
