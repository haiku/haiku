summary			"The Haiku welcome documentation"
description		"The Haiku welcome documentation was put together especially \
for new users. It provides information on how to report bugs and answers the \
most pressing questions like how to find and install software, how to get in \
contact and where to find more resources for programmers and endusers online.
A quick tour of the system shows many of Haiku's distinguishing (and at times \
not obvious) features.

This package includes several translations of the welcome documentation.
Thanks to everyone who contributed!"
