summary			"The Haiku user documentation (Spanish translation)"
description		"The Haiku User Guide describes the Haiku operating system \
from a user's perspective.
It's recommended reading for people that are new to the system as well as the \
seasoned Haiku or former BeOS user. It describes the fundamentals of the \
graphical user interface as well as the special features that are unique to \
the BeOS/Haiku system. All included applications and preferences are \
described in detail and tips and little workshops help to work most \
efficiently under Haiku.

This is the Spanish translation of the Haiku User Guide. Thanks to everyone \
who contributed!"
