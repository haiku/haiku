Introduction
************

   This manual is a work in progress: many sections make no attempt to
explain basic concepts in a way suitable for novices.  Thus, if you are
interested, please get involved in improving this manual.  The entire
GNU community will benefit.

   The GNU utilities documented here are mostly compatible with the
POSIX standard.  Please report bugs to <bug-coreutils@gnu.org>.
Remember to include the version number, machine architecture, input
files, and any other information needed to reproduce the bug: your
input, what you expected, what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are
welcome, but please include a description of the problem as well, since
this is sometimes difficult to infer. *Note Bugs: (gcc)Bugs.

   This manual was originally derived from the Unix man pages in the
distributions, which were written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim
Meyering.  What you are reading now is the authoritative documentation
for these utilities; the man pages are no longer being maintained.  The
original `fmt' man page was written by Ross Paterson.  Franc,ois Pinard
did the initial conversion to Texinfo format.  Karl Berry did the
indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results.  Brian
Youmans of the Free Software Foundation office staff combined the
manuals for textutils, fileutils, and sh-utils to produce the present
omnibus manual.  Richard Stallman contributed his usual invaluable
insights to the overall process.

Common options
**************

   Certain options are available in all of these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

   Normally options and operands can appear in any order, and programs
act as if all the options appear before any operands.  For example,
`sort -r passwd -t :' acts like `sort -r -t : passwd', since `:' is an
option-argument of `-t'.  However, if the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment
variable is set, options must appear before operands, unless otherwise
specified for a particular command.

   Some of these programs recognize the `--help' and `--version'
options only when one of them is the sole command line argument.

`--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

`--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

`--'
     Delimit the option list.  Later arguments, if any, are treated as
     operands even if they begin with `-'.  For example, `sort -- -r'
     reads from the file named `-r'.


   A single `-' is not really an option, though it looks like one.  It
stands for standard input, or for standard output if that is clear from
the context, and it can be used either as an operand or as an
option-argument.  For example, `sort -o - -' outputs to standard output
and reads from standard input, and is equivalent to plain `sort'.
Unless otherwise specified, `-' can appear in any context that requires
a file name.

Exit status
===========

   Nearly every command invocation yields an integral "exit status"
that can be used to change how other commands work.  For the vast
majority of commands, an exit status of zero indicates success, and a
value of `1' indicates failure.  However, some of the programs
documented here do produce other exit status values and a few associate
different meanings with the values `0' and `1'.  Here are some of the
exceptions: `expr', `false', `nohup', `printenv', `sort', `test',
`true', `tty', `uniq'.

Backup options
==============

   Some GNU programs (at least `cp', `install', `ln', and `mv')
optionally make backups of files before writing new versions.  These
options control the details of these backups.  The options are also
briefly mentioned in the descriptions of the particular programs.

`-b'
`--backup[=METHOD]'
     Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
     removed.  Without this option, the original versions are destroyed.
     Use METHOD to determine the type of backups to make.  When this
     option is used but METHOD is not specified, then the value of the
     `VERSION_CONTROL' environment variable is used.  And if
     `VERSION_CONTROL' is not set, the default backup type is
     `existing'.

     Note that the short form of this option, `-b' does not accept any
     argument.  Using `-b' is equivalent to using `--backup=existing'.

     This option corresponds to the Emacs variable `version-control';
     the values for METHOD are the same as those used in Emacs.  This
     option also accepts more descriptive names.  The valid METHODs are
     (unique abbreviations are accepted):

    `none'
    `off'
          Never make backups.

    `numbered'
    `t'
          Always make numbered backups.

    `existing'
    `nil'
          Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple
          backups of the others.

    `simple'
    `never'
          Always make simple backups.  Please note `never' is not to be
          confused with `none'.


`-S SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with `-b'.  If this option
     is not specified, the value of the `SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX'
     environment variable is used.  And if `SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX' is not
     set, the default is `~', just as in Emacs.

`--version-control=METHOD'
     This option is obsolete and will be removed in a future release.
     It has been replaced with `--backup'.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Block size,  Next: Target directory,  Prev: Backup options,  Up: Common options

Block size
==========

   Some GNU programs (at least `df', `du', and `ls') display sizes in
"blocks".  You can adjust the block size and method of display to make
sizes easier to read.  The block size used for display is independent
of any filesystem block size.  Fractional block counts are rounded up
to the nearest integer.

   The default block size is chosen by examining the following
environment variables in turn; the first one that is set determines the
block size.

`DF_BLOCK_SIZE'
     This specifies the default block size for the `df' command.
     Similarly, `DU_BLOCK_SIZE' specifies the default for `du' and
     `LS_BLOCK_SIZE' for `ls'.

`BLOCK_SIZE'
     This specifies the default block size for all three commands, if
     the above command-specific environment variables are not set.

`POSIXLY_CORRECT'
     If neither the `COMMAND_BLOCK_SIZE' nor the `BLOCK_SIZE' variables
     are set, but this variable is set, the block size defaults to 512.


   If none of the above environment variables are set, the block size
currently defaults to 1024 bytes in most contexts, but this number may
change in the future.  For `ls' file sizes, the block size defaults to
1 byte.

   A block size specification can be a positive integer specifying the
number of bytes per block, or it can be `human-readable' or `si' to
select a human-readable format.  Integers may be followed by suffixes
that are upward compatible with the SI prefixes
(http://www.bipm.fr/enus/3_SI/si-prefixes.html) for decimal multiples
and with the IEC 60027-2 prefixes for binary multiples
(http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html).

   With human-readable formats, output sizes are followed by a size
letter such as `M' for megabytes.  `BLOCK_SIZE=human-readable' uses
powers of 1024; `M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.  `BLOCK_SIZE=si' is
similar, but uses powers of 1000 and appends `B'; `MB' stands for
1,000,000 bytes.

   A block size specification preceded by `'' causes output sizes to be
displayed with thousands separators.  The `LC_NUMERIC' locale specifies
the thousands separator and grouping.  For example, in an American
English locale, `--block-size="'1kB"' would cause a size of 1234000
bytes to be displayed as `1,234'.  In the default C locale, there is no
thousands separator so a leading `'' has no effect.

   An integer block size can be followed by a suffix to specify a
multiple of that size.  A bare size letter, or one followed by `iB',
specifies a multiple using powers of 1024.  A size letter followed by
`B' specifies powers of 1000 instead.  For example, `1M' and `1MiB' are
equivalent to `1048576', whereas `1MB' is equivalent to `1000000'.

   A plain suffix without a preceding integer acts as if `1' were
prepended, except that it causes a size indication to be appended to
the output.  For example, `--block-size="kB"' displays 3000 as `3kB'.

   The following suffixes are defined.  Large sizes like `1Y' may be
rejected by your computer due to limitations of its arithmetic.

`kB'
     kilobyte: 10^3 = 1000.

`k'
`K'
`KiB'
     kibibyte: 2^10 = 1024.  `K' is special: the SI prefix is `k' and
     the IEC 60027-2 prefix is `Ki', but tradition and POSIX use `k' to
     mean `KiB'.

`MB'
     megabyte: 10^6 = 1,000,000.

`M'
`MiB'
     mebibyte: 2^20 = 1,048,576.

`GB'
     gigabyte: 10^9 = 1,000,000,000.

`G'
`GiB'
     gibibyte: 2^30 = 1,073,741,824.

`TB'
     terabyte:  10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000.

`T'
`TiB'
     tebibyte: 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776.

`PB'
     petabyte: 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000.

`P'
`PiB'
     pebibyte: 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624.

`EB'
     exabyte: 10^18 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

`E'
`EiB'
     exbibyte: 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976.

`ZB'
     zettabyte: 10^21 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

`Z'
`ZiB'
     2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424.  (`Zi' is a GNU extension to
     IEC 60027-2.)

`YB'
     yottabyte: 10^24 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

`Y'
`YiB'
     2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176.  (`Yi' is a GNU
     extension to IEC 60027-2.)

   Block size defaults can be overridden by an explicit
`--block-size=SIZE' option.  The `-k' option is equivalent to
`--block-size=1K', which is the default unless the `POSIXLY_CORRECT'
environment variable is set.  The `-h' or `--human-readable' option is
equivalent to `--block-size=human-readable'.  The `--si' option is
equivalent to `--block-size=si'.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Target directory,  Next: Trailing slashes,  Prev: Block size,  Up: Common options

Target directory
================

   Some GNU programs (at least `cp', `install', `ln', and `mv') allow
you to specify the target directory via this option:

`--target-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specify the destination DIRECTORY.

     The interface for most programs is that after processing options
     and a finite (possibly zero) number of fixed-position arguments,
     the remaining argument list is either expected to be empty, or is
     a list of items (usually files) that will all be handled
     identically.  The `xargs' program is designed to work well with
     this convention.

     The commands in the `mv'-family are unusual in that they take a
     variable number of arguments with a special case at the _end_
     (namely, the target directory).  This makes it nontrivial to
     perform some operations, e.g., "move all files from here to
     ../d/", because `mv * ../d/' might exhaust the argument space, and
     `ls | xargs ...' doesn't have a clean way to specify an extra
     final argument for each invocation of the subject command.  (It
     can be done by going through a shell command, but that requires
     more human labor and brain power than it should.)

     The `--target-directory' option allows the `cp', `install', `ln',
     and `mv' programs to be used conveniently with `xargs'.  For
     example, you can move the files from the current directory to a
     sibling directory, `d' like this: (However, this doesn't move
     files whose names begin with `.'.)

          ls |xargs mv --target-directory=../d

     If you use the GNU `find' program, you can move _all_ files with
     this command:
          find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \
            | xargs mv --target-directory=../d

     But that will fail if there are no files in the current directory
     or if any file has a name containing a newline character.  The
     following example removes those limitations and requires both GNU
     `find' and GNU `xargs':
          find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0 \
            | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty \
                mv --target-directory=../d

Trailing slashes
================

   Some GNU programs (at least `cp' and `mv') allow you to remove any
trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument before operating on it.  The
`--strip-trailing-slashes' option enables this behavior.

   This is useful when a SOURCE argument may have a trailing slash and
specify a symbolic link to a directory.  This scenario is in fact rather
common because some shells can automatically append a trailing slash
when performing file name completion on such symbolic links.  Without
this option, `mv', for example, (via the system's rename function) must
interpret a trailing slash as a request to dereference the symbolic link
and so must rename the indirectly referenced _directory_ and not the
symbolic link.  Although it may seem surprising that such behavior be
the default, it is required by POSIX and is consistent with other parts
of that standard.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Standards conformance,  Prev: Trailing slashes,  Up: Common options

Standards conformance
=====================

   In a few cases, the GNU utilities' default behavior is incompatible
with the POSIX standard.  To suppress these incompatibilities, define
the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable.  Unless you are checking
for POSIX conformance, you probably do not need to define
`POSIXLY_CORRECT'.

   Newer versions of POSIX are occasionally incompatible with older
versions.  For example, older versions of POSIX required the command
`sort +1' to sort based on the second and succeeding fields in each
input line, but starting with POSIX 1003.1-2001 the same command is
required to sort the file named `+1', and you must instead use the
command `sort -k 2' to get the field-based sort.

   The GNU utilities normally conform to the version of POSIX that is
standard for your system.  To cause them to conform to a different
version of POSIX, define the `_POSIX2_VERSION' environment variable to
a value of the form YYYYMM specifying the year and month the standard
was adopted.  Two values are currently supported for `_POSIX2_VERSION':
`199209' stands for POSIX 1003.2-1992, and `200112' stands for POSIX
1003.1-2001.  For example, if you are running older software that
assumes an older version of POSIX and uses `sort +1', you can work
around the compatibility problems by setting `_POSIX2_VERSION=199209'
in your environment.

`cat': Concatenate and write files
==================================

   `cat' copies each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output.  Synopsis:

     cat [OPTION] [FILE]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-A'
`--show-all'
     Equivalent to `-vET'.

`-B'
`--binary'
     On MS-DOS and MS-Windows only, read and write the files in binary
     mode.  By default, `cat' on MS-DOS/MS-Windows uses binary mode
     only when standard output is redirected to a file or a pipe; this
     option overrides that.  Binary file I/O is used so that the files
     retain their format (Unix text as opposed to DOS text and binary),
     because `cat' is frequently used as a file-copying program.  Some
     options (see below) cause `cat' to read and write files in text
     mode because in those cases the original file contents aren't
     important (e.g., when lines are numbered by `cat', or when line
     endings should be marked).  This is so these options work as
     DOS/Windows users would expect; for example, DOS-style text files
     have their lines end with the CR-LF pair of characters, which
     won't be processed as an empty line by `-b' unless the file is
     read in text mode.

`-b'
`--number-nonblank'
     Number all nonblank output lines, starting with 1.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-e'
     Equivalent to `-vE'.

`-E'
`--show-ends'
     Display a `$' after the end of each line.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-n'
`--number'
     Number all output lines, starting with 1.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-s'
`--squeeze-blank'
     Replace multiple adjacent blank lines with a single blank line.  On
     MS-DOS and MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write
     files in text mode.

`-t'
     Equivalent to `-vT'.

`-T'
`--show-tabs'
     Display TAB characters as `^I'.

`-u'
     Ignored; for Unix compatibility.

`-v'
`--show-nonprinting'
     Display control characters except for LFD and TAB using `^'
     notation and precede characters that have the high bit set with
     `M-'.  On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read
     files and standard input in DOS binary mode, so the CR characters
     at the end of each line are also visible.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: tac invocation,  Next: nl invocation,  Prev: cat invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`tac': Concatenate and write files in reverse
=============================================

   `tac' copies each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, reversing the records (lines by
default) in each separately.  Synopsis:

     tac [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   "Records" are separated by instances of a string (newline by
default).  By default, this separator string is attached to the end of
the record that it follows in the file.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--before'
     The separator is attached to the beginning of the record that it
     precedes in the file.

`-r'
`--regex'
     Treat the separator string as a regular expression.  Users of `tac'
     on MS-DOS/MS-Windows should note that, since `tac' reads files in
     binary mode, each line of a text file might end with a CR/LF pair
     instead of the Unix-style LF.

`-s SEPARATOR'
`--separator=SEPARATOR'
     Use SEPARATOR as the record separator, instead of newline.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: nl invocation,  Next: od invocation,  Prev: tac invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`nl': Number lines and write files
==================================

   `nl' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, with line numbers added to some
or all of the lines.  Synopsis:

     nl [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `nl' decomposes its input into (logical) pages; by default, the line
number is reset to 1 at the top of each logical page.  `nl' treats all
of the input files as a single document; it does not reset line numbers
or logical pages between files.

   A logical page consists of three sections: header, body, and footer.
Any of the sections can be empty.  Each can be numbered in a different
style from the others.

   The beginnings of the sections of logical pages are indicated in the
input file by a line containing exactly one of these delimiter strings:

`\:\:\:'
     start of header;

`\:\:'
     start of body;

`\:'
     start of footer.

   The two characters from which these strings are made can be changed
from `\' and `:' via options (see below), but the pattern and length of
each string cannot be changed.

   A section delimiter is replaced by an empty line on output.  Any text
that comes before the first section delimiter string in the input file
is considered to be part of a body section, so `nl' treats a file that
contains no section delimiters as a single body section.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b STYLE'
`--body-numbering=STYLE'
     Select the numbering style for lines in the body section of each
     logical page.  When a line is not numbered, the current line number
     is not incremented, but the line number separator character is
     still prepended to the line.  The styles are:

    `a'
          number all lines,

    `t'
          number only nonempty lines (default for body),

    `n'
          do not number lines (default for header and footer),

    `pREGEXP'
          number only lines that contain a match for REGEXP.

`-d CD'
`--section-delimiter=CD'
     Set the section delimiter characters to CD; default is `\:'. If
     only C is given, the second remains `:'.  (Remember to protect `\'
     or other metacharacters from shell expansion with quotes or extra
     backslashes.)

`-f STYLE'
`--footer-numbering=STYLE'
     Analogous to `--body-numbering'.

`-h STYLE'
`--header-numbering=STYLE'
     Analogous to `--body-numbering'.

`-i NUMBER'
`--page-increment=NUMBER'
     Increment line numbers by NUMBER (default 1).

`-l NUMBER'
`--join-blank-lines=NUMBER'
     Consider NUMBER (default 1) consecutive empty lines to be one
     logical line for numbering, and only number the last one.  Where
     fewer than NUMBER consecutive empty lines occur, do not number
     them.  An empty line is one that contains no characters, not even
     spaces or tabs.

`-n FORMAT'
`--number-format=FORMAT'
     Select the line numbering format (default is `rn'):

    `ln'
          left justified, no leading zeros;

    `rn'
          right justified, no leading zeros;

    `rz'
          right justified, leading zeros.

`-p'
`--no-renumber'
     Do not reset the line number at the start of a logical page.

`-s STRING'
`--number-separator=STRING'
     Separate the line number from the text line in the output with
     STRING (default is the TAB character).

`-v NUMBER'
`--starting-line-number=NUMBER'
     Set the initial line number on each logical page to NUMBER
     (default 1).

`-w NUMBER'
`--number-width=NUMBER'
     Use NUMBER characters for line numbers (default 6).



File: coreutils.info,  Node: od invocation,  Prev: nl invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`od': Write files in octal or other formats
===========================================

   `od' writes an unambiguous representation of each FILE (`-' means
standard input), or standard input if none are given.  Synopses:

     od [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     od --traditional [FILE] [[+]OFFSET [[+]LABEL]]

   Each line of output consists of the offset in the input, followed by
groups of data from the file. By default, `od' prints the offset in
octal, and each group of file data is two bytes of input printed as a
single octal number.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-A RADIX'
`--address-radix=RADIX'
     Select the base in which file offsets are printed.  RADIX can be
     one of the following:

    `d'
          decimal;

    `o'
          octal;

    `x'
          hexadecimal;

    `n'
          none (do not print offsets).

     The default is octal.

`-j BYTES'
`--skip-bytes=BYTES'
     Skip BYTES input bytes before formatting and writing.  If BYTES
     begins with `0x' or `0X', it is interpreted in hexadecimal;
     otherwise, if it begins with `0', in octal; otherwise, in decimal.
     Appending `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by
     1048576.

`-N BYTES'
`--read-bytes=BYTES'
     Output at most BYTES bytes of the input.  Prefixes and suffixes on
     `bytes' are interpreted as for the `-j' option.

`-s N'
`--strings[=N]'
     Instead of the normal output, output only "string constants": at
     least N consecutive ASCII graphic characters, followed by a null
     (zero) byte.

     If N is omitted with `--strings', the default is 3.  On older
     systems, GNU `od' instead supports an obsolete option `-s[N]',
     where N also defaults to 3.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards
     conformance::) does not allow `-s' without an argument; use
     `--strings' instead.

`-t TYPE'
`--format=TYPE'
     Select the format in which to output the file data.  TYPE is a
     string of one or more of the below type indicator characters.  If
     you include more than one type indicator character in a single TYPE
     string, or use this option more than once, `od' writes one copy of
     each output line using each of the data types that you specified,
     in the order that you specified.

     Adding a trailing "z" to any type specification appends a display
     of the ASCII character representation of the printable characters
     to the output line generated by the type specification.

    `a'
          named character

    `c'
          ASCII character or backslash escape,

    `d'
          signed decimal

    `f'
          floating point

    `o'
          octal

    `u'
          unsigned decimal

    `x'
          hexadecimal

     The type `a' outputs things like `sp' for space, `nl' for newline,
     and `nul' for a null (zero) byte.  Type `c' outputs ` ', `\n', and
     `\0', respectively.

     Except for types `a' and `c', you can specify the number of bytes
     to use in interpreting each number in the given data type by
     following the type indicator character with a decimal integer.
     Alternately, you can specify the size of one of the C compiler's
     built-in data types by following the type indicator character with
     one of the following characters.  For integers (`d', `o', `u',
     `x'):

    `C'
          char

    `S'
          short

    `I'
          int

    `L'
          long

     For floating point (`f'):

    F
          float

    D
          double

    L
          long double

`-v'
`--output-duplicates'
     Output consecutive lines that are identical.  By default, when two
     or more consecutive output lines would be identical, `od' outputs
     only the first line, and puts just an asterisk on the following
     line to indicate the elision.

`-w N'
`--width[=N]'
     Dump `n' input bytes per output line.  This must be a multiple of
     the least common multiple of the sizes associated with the
     specified output types.

     If this option is not given at all, the default is 16.  If N is
     omitted with `--width', the default is 32.  On older systems, GNU
     `od' instead supports an obsolete option `-w[N]', where N also
     defaults to 32.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::)
     does not allow `-w' without an argument; use `--width' instead.


   The next several options are shorthands for format specifications.
GNU `od' accepts any combination of shorthands and format specification
options.  These options accumulate.

`-a'
     Output as named characters.  Equivalent to `-ta'.

`-b'
     Output as octal bytes.  Equivalent to `-toC'.

`-c'
     Output as ASCII characters or backslash escapes.  Equivalent to
     `-tc'.

`-d'
     Output as unsigned decimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tu2'.

`-f'
     Output as floats.  Equivalent to `-tfF'.

`-h'
     Output as hexadecimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tx2'.

`-i'
     Output as decimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-td2'.

`-l'
     Output as decimal longs.  Equivalent to `-td4'.

`-o'
     Output as octal shorts.  Equivalent to `-to2'.

`-x'
     Output as hexadecimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tx2'.

`--traditional'
     Recognize the non-option arguments that traditional `od' accepted.
     The following syntax:

          od --traditional [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b] [[+]LABEL[.][b]]]

     can be used to specify at most one file and optional arguments
     specifying an offset and a pseudo-start address, LABEL.  By
     default, OFFSET is interpreted as an octal number specifying how
     many input bytes to skip before formatting and writing.  The
     optional trailing decimal point forces the interpretation of
     OFFSET as a decimal number.  If no decimal is specified and the
     offset begins with `0x' or `0X' it is interpreted as a hexadecimal
     number.  If there is a trailing `b', the number of bytes skipped
     will be OFFSET multiplied by 512.  The LABEL argument is
     interpreted just like OFFSET, but it specifies an initial
     pseudo-address.  The pseudo-addresses are displayed in parentheses
     following any normal address.

`fmt': Reformat paragraph text
==============================

   `fmt' fills and joins lines to produce output lines of (at most) a
given number of characters (75 by default).  Synopsis:

     fmt [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `fmt' reads from the specified FILE arguments (or standard input if
none are given), and writes to standard output.

   By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation are
preserved in the output; successive input lines with different
indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on
output.

   `fmt' prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to
avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last
word of a sentence.  A "sentence break" is defined as either the end of
a paragraph or a word ending in any of `.?!', followed by two spaces or
end of line, ignoring any intervening parentheses or quotes.  Like TeX,
`fmt' reads entire "paragraphs" before choosing line breaks; the
algorithm is a variant of that in "Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines"
(Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass, `Software--Practice and
Experience', 11 (1981), 1119-1184).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--crown-margin'
     "Crown margin" mode: preserve the indentation of the first two
     lines within a paragraph, and align the left margin of each
     subsequent line with that of the second line.

`-t'
`--tagged-paragraph'
     "Tagged paragraph" mode: like crown margin mode, except that if
     indentation of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the
     indentation of the second, the first line is treated as a one-line
     paragraph.

`-s'
`--split-only'
     Split lines only.  Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
     This prevents sample lines of code, and other such "formatted"
     text from being unduly combined.

`-u'
`--uniform-spacing'
     Uniform spacing.  Reduce spacing between words to one space, and
     spacing between sentences to two spaces.

`-WIDTH'
`-w WIDTH'
`--width=WIDTH'
     Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).  `fmt'
     initially tries to make lines about 7% shorter than this, to give
     it room to balance line lengths.

`-p PREFIX'
`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Only lines beginning with PREFIX (possibly preceded by whitespace)
     are subject to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace
     are stripped for the formatting and then re-attached to each
     formatted output line.  One use is to format certain kinds of
     program comments, while leaving the code unchanged.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: pr invocation,  Next: fold invocation,  Prev: fmt invocation,  Up: Formatting file contents

`pr': Paginate or columnate files for printing
==============================================

   `pr' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, paginating and optionally
outputting in multicolumn format; optionally merges all FILEs, printing
all in parallel, one per column.  Synopsis:

     pr [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, a 5-line header is printed at each page: two blank lines;
a line with the date, the filename, and the page count; and two more
blank lines.  A footer of five blank lines is also printed.  With the
`-F' option, a 3-line header is printed: the leading two blank lines are
omitted; no footer is used.  The default PAGE_LENGTH in both cases is 66
lines.  The default number of text lines changes from 56 (without `-F')
to 63 (with `-F').  The text line of the header takes the form `DATE
STRING PAGE', with spaces inserted around STRING so that the line takes
up the full PAGE_WIDTH.  Here, DATE is the date (see the `-D' or
`--date-format' option for details), STRING is the centered header
string, and PAGE identifies the page number.  The `LC_MESSAGES' locale
category affects the spelling of PAGE; in the default C locale, it is
`Page NUMBER' where NUMBER is the decimal page number.

   Form feeds in the input cause page breaks in the output.  Multiple
form feeds produce empty pages.

   Columns are of equal width, separated by an optional string (default
is `space').  For multicolumn output, lines will always be truncated to
PAGE_WIDTH (default 72), unless you use the `-J' option.  For single
column output no line truncation occurs by default.  Use `-W' option to
truncate lines in that case.

   The following changes were made in version 1.22i and apply to later
versions of `pr':  - Brian
   * Some small LETTER OPTIONS (`-s', `-w') have been redefined for
     better POSIX compliance.  The output of some further cases has
     been adapted to other Unix systems.  These changes are not
     compatible with earlier versions of the program.

   * Some NEW CAPITAL LETTER options (`-J', `-S', `-W') have been
     introduced to turn off unexpected interferences of small letter
     options.  The `-N' option and the second argument LAST_PAGE of
     `+FIRST_PAGE' offer more flexibility.  The detailed handling of
     form feeds set in the input files requires the `-T' option.

   * Capital letter options override small letter ones.

   * Some of the option-arguments (compare `-s', `-e', `-i', `-n')
     cannot be specified as separate arguments from the preceding
     option letter (already stated in the POSIX specification).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`+FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]'
`--pages=FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]'
     Begin printing with page FIRST_PAGE and stop with LAST_PAGE.
     Missing `:LAST_PAGE' implies end of file.  While estimating the
     number of skipped pages each form feed in the input file results
     in a new page.  Page counting with and without `+FIRST_PAGE' is
     identical.  By default, counting starts with the first page of
     input file (not first page printed).  Line numbering may be
     altered by `-N' option.

`-COLUMN'
`--columns=COLUMN'
     With each single FILE, produce COLUMN columns of output (default
     is 1) and print columns down, unless `-a' is used.  The column
     width is automatically decreased as COLUMN increases; unless you
     use the `-W/-w' option to increase PAGE_WIDTH as well.  This
     option might well cause some lines to be truncated.  The number of
     lines in the columns on each page are balanced.  The options `-e'
     and `-i' are on for multiple text-column output.  Together with
     `-J' option column alignment and line truncation is turned off.
     Lines of full length are joined in a free field format and `-S'
     option may set field separators.  `-COLUMN' may not be used with
     `-m' option.

`-a'
`--across'
     With each single FILE, print columns across rather than down.  The
     `-COLUMN' option must be given with COLUMN greater than one.  If a
     line is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated.

`-c'
`--show-control-chars'
     Print control characters using hat notation (e.g., `^G'); print
     other nonprinting characters in octal backslash notation.  By
     default, nonprinting characters are not changed.

`-d'
`--double-space'
     Double space the output.

`-D FORMAT'
`--date-format=FORMAT'
     Format header dates using FORMAT, using the same conventions as
     for the the command `date +FORMAT'; *Note date invocation::.
     Except for directives, which start with `%', characters in FORMAT
     are printed unchanged.  You can use this option to specify an
     arbitrary string in place of the header date, e.g.,
     `--date-format="Monday morning"'.

     If the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable is not set, the date
     format defaults to `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' (for example, `2001-12-04
     23:59'); otherwise, the format depends on the `LC_TIME' locale
     category, with the default being `%b %e %H:%M %Y' (for example,
     `Dec  4 23:59 2001'.

`-e[IN-TABCHAR[IN-TABWIDTH]]'
`--expand-tabs[=IN-TABCHAR[IN-TABWIDTH]]'
     Expand TABs to spaces on input.  Optional argument IN-TABCHAR is
     the input tab character (default is the TAB character).  Second
     optional argument IN-TABWIDTH is the input tab character's width
     (default is 8).

`-f'
`-F'
`--form-feed'
     Use a form feed instead of newlines to separate output pages.  The
     default page length of 66 lines is not altered.  But the number of
     lines of text per page changes from default 56 to 63 lines.

`-h HEADER'
`--header=HEADER'
     Replace the filename in the header with the centered string HEADER.
     When using the shell, HEADER should be quoted and should be
     separated from `-h' by a space.

`-i[OUT-TABCHAR[OUT-TABWIDTH]]'
`--output-tabs[=OUT-TABCHAR[OUT-TABWIDTH]]'
     Replace spaces with TABs on output.  Optional argument OUT-TABCHAR
     is the output tab character (default is the TAB character).
     Second optional argument OUT-TABWIDTH is the output tab
     character's width (default is 8).

`-J'
`--join-lines'
     Merge lines of full length.  Used together with the column options
     `-COLUMN', `-a -COLUMN' or `-m'.  Turns off `-W/-w' line
     truncation; no column alignment used; may be used with
     `--sep-string[=STRING]'.  `-J' has been introduced (together with
     `-W' and `--sep-string') to disentangle the old (POSIX-compliant)
     options `-w' and `-s' along with the three column options.

`-l PAGE_LENGTH'
`--length=PAGE_LENGTH'
     Set the page length to PAGE_LENGTH (default 66) lines, including
     the lines of the header [and the footer].  If PAGE_LENGTH is less
     than or equal to 10 (or <= 3 with `-F'), the header and footer are
     omitted, and all form feeds set in input files are eliminated, as
     if the `-T' option had been given.

`-m'
`--merge'
     Merge and print all FILEs in parallel, one in each column.  If a
     line is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated, unless the
     `-J' option is used.  `--sep-string[=STRING]' may be used.  Empty
     pages in some FILEs (form feeds set) produce empty columns, still
     marked by STRING.  The result is a continuous line numbering and
     column marking throughout the whole merged file.  Completely empty
     merged pages show no separators or line numbers.  The default
     header becomes `DATE PAGE' with spaces inserted in the middle; this
     may be used with the `-h' or `--header' option to fill up the
     middle blank part.

`-n[NUMBER-SEPARATOR[DIGITS]]'
`--number-lines[=NUMBER-SEPARATOR[DIGITS]]'
     Provide DIGITS digit line numbering (default for DIGITS is 5).
     With multicolumn output the number occupies the first DIGITS
     column positions of each text column or only each line of `-m'
     output.  With single column output the number precedes each line
     just as `-m' does.  Default counting of the line numbers starts
     with the first line of the input file (not the first line printed,
     compare the `--page' option and `-N' option).  Optional argument
     NUMBER-SEPARATOR is the character appended to the line number to
     separate it from the text followed.  The default separator is the
     TAB character.  In a strict sense a TAB is always printed with
     single column output only.  The TAB-width varies with the
     TAB-position, e.g. with the left MARGIN specified by `-o' option.
     With multicolumn output priority is given to `equal width of
     output columns' (a POSIX specification).  The TAB-width is fixed
     to the value of the first column and does not change with
     different values of left MARGIN.  That means a fixed number of
     spaces is always printed in the place of the NUMBER-SEPARATOR TAB.
     The tabification depends upon the output position.

`-N LINE_NUMBER'
`--first-line-number=LINE_NUMBER'
     Start line counting with the number LINE_NUMBER at first line of
     first page printed (in most cases not the first line of the input
     file).

`-o MARGIN'
`--indent=MARGIN'
     Indent each line with a margin MARGIN spaces wide (default is
     zero).  The total page width is the size of the margin plus the
     PAGE_WIDTH set with the `-W/-w' option.  A limited overflow may
     occur with numbered single column output (compare `-n' option).

`-r'
`--no-file-warnings'
     Do not print a warning message when an argument FILE cannot be
     opened.  (The exit status will still be nonzero, however.)

`-s[CHAR]'
`--separator[=CHAR]'
     Separate columns by a single character CHAR.  The default for CHAR
     is the TAB character without `-w' and `no character' with `-w'.
     Without `-s' the default separator `space' is set.  `-s[char]'
     turns off line truncation of all three column options
     (`-COLUMN'|`-a -COLUMN'|`-m') unless `-w' is set.  This is a
     POSIX-compliant formulation.

`-S STRING'
`--sep-string[=STRING]'
     Use STRING to separate output columns.  The `-S' option doesn't
     affect the `-W/-w' option, unlike the `-s' option which does.  It
     does not affect line truncation or column alignment.  Without
     `-S', and with `-J', `pr' uses the default output separator, TAB.
     Without `-S' or `-J', `pr' uses a `space' (same as `-S" "').  With
     `-SSTRING', STRING must be nonempty; `--sep-string' with no STRING
     is equivalent to `--sep-string=""'.

     On older systems, `pr' instead supports an obsolete option
     `-S[STRING]', where STRING is optional.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note
     Standards conformance::) does not allow this older usage.  To
     specify an empty STRING portably, use `--sep-string'.

`-t'
`--omit-header'
     Do not print the usual header [and footer] on each page, and do
     not fill out the bottom of pages (with blank lines or a form
     feed).  No page structure is produced, but form feeds set in the
     input files are retained.  The predefined pagination is not
     changed.  `-t' or `-T' may be useful together with other options;
     e.g.: `-t -e4', expand TAB characters in the input file to 4
     spaces but don't make any other changes.  Use of `-t' overrides
     `-h'.

`-T'
`--omit-pagination'
     Do not print header [and footer].  In addition eliminate all form
     feeds set in the input files.

`-v'
`--show-nonprinting'
     Print nonprinting characters in octal backslash notation.

`-w PAGE_WIDTH'
`--width=PAGE_WIDTH'
     Set page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters for multiple text-column
     output only (default for PAGE_WIDTH is 72).  `-s[CHAR]' turns off
     the default page width and any line truncation and column
     alignment.  Lines of full length are merged, regardless of the
     column options set.  No PAGE_WIDTH setting is possible with single
     column output.  A POSIX-compliant formulation.

`-W PAGE_WIDTH'
`--page_width=PAGE_WIDTH'
     Set the page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters.  That's valid with and
     without a column option.  Text lines are truncated, unless `-J' is
     used.  Together with one of the three column options (`-COLUMN',
     `-a -COLUMN' or `-m') column alignment is always used.  The
     separator options `-S' or `-s' don't affect the `-W' option.
     Default is 72 characters.  Without `-W PAGE_WIDTH' and without any
     of the column options NO line truncation is used (defined to keep
     downward compatibility and to meet most frequent tasks).  That's
     equivalent to `-W 72 -J'.  The header line is never truncated.

`fold': Wrap input lines to fit in specified width
==================================================

   `fold' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard
input if none are given, to standard output, breaking long lines.
Synopsis:

     fold [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `fold' breaks lines wider than 80 columns.  The output
is split into as many lines as necessary.

   `fold' counts screen columns by default; thus, a tab may count more
than one column, backspace decreases the column count, and carriage
return sets the column to zero.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--bytes'
     Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and
     carriage returns are each counted as taking up one column, just
     like other characters.

`-s'
`--spaces'
     Break at word boundaries: the line is broken after the last blank
     before the maximum line length.  If the line contains no such
     blanks, the line is broken at the maximum line length as usual.

`-w WIDTH'
`--width=WIDTH'
     Use a maximum line length of WIDTH columns instead of 80.

     On older systems, `fold' supports an obsolete option `-WIDTH'.
     POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow
     this; use `-w WIDTH' instead.

`head': Output the first part of files
======================================

   `head' prints the first part (10 lines by default) of each FILE; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a FILE of
`-'.  Synopsis:

     head [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If more than one FILE is specified, `head' prints a one-line header
consisting of
     ==> FILE NAME <==

before the output for each FILE.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Print the first BYTES bytes, instead of initial lines.  Appending
     `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by 1048576.

`-n N'
`--lines=N'
     Output the first N lines.

`-q'
`--quiet'

     Always print file name headers.


   On older systems, `head' supports an obsolete option
`-COUNTOPTIONS', which is recognized only if it is specified first.
COUNT is a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (`b',
`k', `m') as in `-c', or `l' to mean count by lines, or other option
letters (`cqv').  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::)
does not allow this; use `-c COUNT' or `-n COUNT' instead.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: tail invocation,  Next: split invocation,  Prev: head invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`tail': Output the last part of files
=====================================

   `tail' prints the last part (10 lines by default) of each FILE; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a FILE of
`-'.  Synopsis:

     tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If more than one FILE is specified, `tail' prints a one-line header
consisting of
     ==> FILE NAME <==

before the output for each FILE.

   GNU `tail' can output any amount of data (some other versions of
`tail' cannot).  It also has no `-r' option (print in reverse), since
reversing a file is really a different job from printing the end of a
file; BSD `tail' (which is the one with `-r') can only reverse files
that are at most as large as its buffer, which is typically 32 KiB.  A
more reliable and versatile way to reverse files is the GNU `tac'
command.

   If any option-argument is a number N starting with a `+', `tail'
begins printing with the Nth item from the start of each file, instead
of from the end.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Output the last BYTES bytes, instead of final lines.  Appending
     `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by 1048576.

`-f'
`--follow[=HOW]'
     Loop forever trying to read more characters at the end of the file,
     presumably because the file is growing.  This option is ignored
     when reading from a pipe.  If more than one file is given, `tail'
     prints a header whenever it gets output from a different file, to
     indicate which file that output is from.

     There are two ways to specify how you'd like to track files with
     this option, but that difference is noticeable only when a
     followed file is removed or renamed.  If you'd like to continue to
     track the end of a growing file even after it has been unlinked,
     use `--follow=descriptor'.  This is the default behavior, but it
     is not useful if you're tracking a log file that may be rotated
     (removed or renamed, then reopened).  In that case, use
     `--follow=name' to track the named file by reopening it
     periodically to see if it has been removed and recreated by some
     other program.

     No matter which method you use, if the tracked file is determined
     to have shrunk, `tail' prints a message saying the file has been
     truncated and resumes tracking the end of the file from the
     newly-determined endpoint.

     When a file is removed, `tail''s behavior depends on whether it is
     following the name or the descriptor.  When following by name,
     tail can detect that a file has been removed and gives a message
     to that effect, and if `--retry' has been specified it will
     continue checking periodically to see if the file reappears.  When
     following a descriptor, tail does not detect that the file has
     been unlinked or renamed and issues no message;  even though the
     file may no longer be accessible via its original name, it may
     still be growing.

     The option values `descriptor' and `name' may be specified only
     with the long form of the option, not with `-f'.

`-F'
     This option is the same as `--follow=name --retry'.  That is, tail
     will attempt to reopen a file when it is removed.  Should this
     fail, tail will keep trying until it becomes accessible again.

`--retry'
     This option is meaningful only when following by name.  Without
     this option, when tail encounters a file that doesn't exist or is
     otherwise inaccessible, it reports that fact and never checks it
     again.

`--sleep-interval=NUMBER'
     Change the number of seconds to wait between iterations (the
     default is 1.0).  During one iteration, every specified file is
     checked to see if it has Historical implementations of `tail' have
     required that NUMBER be an integer.  However, GNU `tail' accepts
     an arbitrary floating point number.

`--pid=PID'
     When following by name or by descriptor, you may specify the
     process ID, PID, of the sole writer of all FILE arguments.  Then,
     shortly after that process terminates, tail will also terminate.
     This will work properly only if the writer and the tailing process
     are running on the same machine.  For example, to save the output
     of a build in a file and to watch the file grow, if you invoke
     `make' and `tail' like this then the tail process will stop when
     your build completes.  Without this option, you would have had to
     kill the `tail -f' process yourself.
          $ make >& makerr & tail --pid=$! -f makerr
     If you specify a PID that is not in use or that does not correspond
     to the process that is writing to the tailed files, then `tail'
     may terminate long before any FILEs stop growing or it may not
     terminate until long after the real writer has terminated.  Note
     that `--pid' cannot be supported on some systems; `tail' will
     print a warning if this is the case.

`--max-unchanged-stats=N'
     When tailing a file by name, if there have been N (default
     n=5) consecutive iterations for which the size has remained the
     same, then `open'/`fstat' the file to determine if that file name
     is still associated with the same device/inode-number pair as
     before.  When following a log file that is rotated, this is
     approximately the number of seconds between when tail prints the
     last pre-rotation lines and when it prints the lines that have
     accumulated in the new log file.  This option is meaningful only
     when following by name.

`-n N'
`--lines=N'
     Output the last N lines.

`-q'
`--quiet'
`--silent'
     Never print file name headers.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Always print file name headers.


   On older systems, `tail' supports an obsolete option
`-COUNTOPTIONS', which is recognized only if it is specified first.
COUNT is a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (`b',
`k', `m') as in `-c', or `l' to mean count by lines, or other option
letters (`cfqv').  Some older `tail' implementations also support an
obsolete option `+COUNT' with the same meaning as `-+COUNT'.  POSIX
1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow these
options; use `-c COUNT' or `-n COUNT' instead.

`split': Split a file into fixed-size pieces
============================================

   `split' creates output files containing consecutive sections of
INPUT (standard input if none is given or INPUT is `-').  Synopsis:

     split [OPTION] [INPUT [PREFIX]]

   By default, `split' puts 1000 lines of INPUT (or whatever is left
over for the last section), into each output file.

   The output files' names consist of PREFIX (`x' by default) followed
by a group of letters (`aa', `ab', ... by default), such that
concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name produces
the original input file.  If the output file names are exhausted,
`split' reports an error without deleting the output files that it did
create.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a LENGTH'
`--suffix-length=LENGTH'
     Use suffixes of length LENGTH.  The default LENGTH is 2.

`-l LINES'
`--lines=LINES'
     Put LINES lines of INPUT into each output file.

     On older systems, `split' supports an obsolete option `-LINES'.
     POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow
     this; use `-l LINES' instead.

`-b BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Put the first BYTES bytes of INPUT into each output file.
     Appending `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by
     1048576.

`-C BYTES'
`--line-bytes=BYTES'
     Put into each output file as many complete lines of INPUT as
     possible without exceeding BYTES bytes.  For lines longer than
     BYTES bytes, put BYTES bytes into each output file until less than
     BYTES bytes of the line are left, then continue normally.  BYTES
     has the same format as for the `--bytes' option.

`--verbose'
     Write a diagnostic to standard error just before each output file
     is opened.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: csplit invocation,  Prev: split invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`csplit': Split a file into context-determined pieces
=====================================================

   `csplit' creates zero or more output files containing sections of
INPUT (standard input if INPUT is `-').  Synopsis:

     csplit [OPTION]... INPUT PATTERN...

   The contents of the output files are determined by the PATTERN
arguments, as detailed below.  An error occurs if a PATTERN argument
refers to a nonexistent line of the input file (e.g., if no remaining
line matches a given regular expression).  After every PATTERN has been
matched, any remaining input is copied into one last output file.

   By default, `csplit' prints the number of bytes written to each
output file after it has been created.

   The types of pattern arguments are:

`N'
     Create an output file containing the input up to but not including
     line N (a positive integer).  If followed by a repeat count, also
     create an output file containing the next LINE lines of the input
     file once for each repeat.

`/REGEXP/[OFFSET]'
     Create an output file containing the current line up to (but not
     including) the next line of the input file that contains a match
     for REGEXP.  The optional OFFSET is a `+' or `-' followed by a
     positive integer.  If it is given, the input up to the matching
     line plus or minus OFFSET is put into the output file, and the
     line after that begins the next section of input.

`%REGEXP%[OFFSET]'
     Like the previous type, except that it does not create an output
     file, so that section of the input file is effectively ignored.

`{REPEAT-COUNT}'
     Repeat the previous pattern REPEAT-COUNT additional times.
     REPEAT-COUNT can either be a positive integer or an asterisk,
     meaning repeat as many times as necessary until the input is
     exhausted.


   The output files' names consist of a prefix (`xx' by default)
followed by a suffix.  By default, the suffix is an ascending sequence
of two-digit decimal numbers from `00' to `99'.  In any case,
concatenating the output files in sorted order by filename produces the
original input file.

   By default, if `csplit' encounters an error or receives a hangup,
interrupt, quit, or terminate signal, it removes any output files that
it has created so far before it exits.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f PREFIX'
`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Use PREFIX as the output file name prefix.

`-b SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Use SUFFIX as the output file name suffix.  When this option is
     specified, the suffix string must include exactly one
     `printf(3)'-style conversion specification, possibly including
     format specification flags, a field width, a precision
     specifications, or all of these kinds of modifiers.  The format
     letter must convert a binary integer argument to readable form;
     thus, only `d', `i', `u', `o', `x', and `X' conversions are
     allowed.  The entire SUFFIX is given (with the current output file
     number) to `sprintf(3)' to form the file name suffixes for each of
     the individual output files in turn.  If this option is used, the
     `--digits' option is ignored.

`-n DIGITS'
`--digits=DIGITS'
     Use output file names containing numbers that are DIGITS digits
     long instead of the default 2.

`-k'
`--keep-files'
     Do not remove output files when errors are encountered.

`-z'
`--elide-empty-files'
     Suppress the generation of zero-length output files.  (In cases
     where the section delimiters of the input file are supposed to
     mark the first lines of each of the sections, the first output
     file will generally be a zero-length file unless you use this
     option.)  The output file sequence numbers always run
     consecutively starting from 0, even when this option is specified.

`-s'
`-q'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Do not print counts of output file sizes.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: wc invocation,  Next: sum invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`wc': Print byte, word, and line counts
=======================================

   `wc' counts the number of bytes, characters, whitespace-separated
words, and newlines in each given FILE, or standard input if none are
given or for a FILE of `-'.  Synopsis:

     wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `wc' prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was
given as an argument, it prints the file name following the counts.  If
more than one FILE is given, `wc' prints a final line containing the
cumulative counts, with the file name `total'.  The counts are printed
in this order: newlines, words, characters, bytes.  By default, each
count is output right-justified in a 7-byte field with one space
between fields so that the numbers and file names line up nicely in
columns.  However, POSIX requires that there be exactly one space
separating columns.  You can make `wc' use the POSIX-mandated output
format by setting the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable.

   By default, `wc' prints three counts: the newline, words, and byte
counts.  Options can specify that only certain counts be printed.
Options do not undo others previously given, so

     wc --bytes --words

prints both the byte counts and the word counts.

   With the `--max-line-length' option, `wc' prints the length of the
longest line per file, and if there is more than one file it prints the
maximum (not the sum) of those lengths.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--bytes'
     Print only the byte counts.

`-m'
`--chars'
     Print only the character counts.

`-w'
`--words'
     Print only the word counts.

`-l'
`--lines'
     Print only the newline counts.

`-L'
`--max-line-length'
     Print only the maximum line lengths.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: sum invocation,  Next: cksum invocation,  Prev: wc invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`sum': Print checksum and block counts
======================================

   `sum' computes a 16-bit checksum for each given FILE, or standard
input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.  Synopsis:

     sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `sum' prints the checksum for each FILE followed by the number of
blocks in the file (rounded up).  If more than one FILE is given, file
names are also printed (by default).  (With the `--sysv' option,
corresponding file names are printed when there is at least one file
argument.)

   By default, GNU `sum' computes checksums using an algorithm
compatible with BSD `sum' and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte
blocks.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-r'
     Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm.  This option is
     included for compatibility with the System V `sum'.  Unless `-s'
     was also given, it has no effect.

`-s'
`--sysv'
     Compute checksums using an algorithm compatible with System V
     `sum''s default, and print file sizes in units of 512-byte blocks.


   `sum' is provided for compatibility; the `cksum' program (see next
section) is preferable in new applications.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: cksum invocation,  Next: md5sum invocation,  Prev: sum invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`cksum': Print CRC checksum and byte counts
===========================================

   `cksum' computes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for each
given FILE, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.
Synopsis:

     cksum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `cksum' prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number
of bytes in the file, and the filename unless no arguments were given.

   `cksum' is typically used to ensure that files transferred by
unreliable means (e.g., netnews) have not been corrupted, by comparing
the `cksum' output for the received files with the `cksum' output for
the original files (typically given in the distribution).

   The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX standard.  It is not
compatible with the BSD or System V `sum' algorithms (see the previous
section); it is more robust.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: md5sum invocation,  Prev: cksum invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`md5sum': Print or check message-digests
========================================

   `md5sum' computes a 128-bit checksum (or "fingerprint" or
"message-digest") for each specified FILE.  If a FILE is specified as
`-' or if no files are given `md5sum' computes the checksum for the
standard input.  `md5sum' can also determine whether a file and
checksum are consistent. Synopses:

     md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     md5sum [OPTION]... --check [FILE]

   For each FILE, `md5sum' outputs the MD5 checksum, a flag indicating
a binary or text input file, and the filename.  If FILE is omitted or
specified as `-', standard input is read.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--binary'
     Treat all input files as binary.  This option has no effect on Unix
     systems, since they don't distinguish between binary and text
     files.  This option is useful on systems that have different
     internal and external character representations.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this is the default.

`-c'
`--check'
     Read filenames and checksum information from the single FILE (or
     from stdin if no FILE was specified) and report whether each named
     file and the corresponding checksum data are consistent.  The
     input to this mode of `md5sum' is usually the output of a prior,
     checksum-generating run of `md5sum'.  Each valid line of input
     consists of an MD5 checksum, a binary/text flag, and then a
     filename.  Binary files are marked with `*', text with ` '.  For
     each such line, `md5sum' reads the named file and computes its MD5
     checksum.  Then, if the computed message digest does not match the
     one on the line with the filename, the file is noted as having
     failed the test.  Otherwise, the file passes the test.  By
     default, for each valid line, one line is written to standard
     output indicating whether the named file passed the test.  After
     all checks have been performed, if there were any failures, a
     warning is issued to standard error.  Use the `--status' option to
     inhibit that output.  If any listed file cannot be opened or read,
     if any valid line has an MD5 checksum inconsistent with the
     associated file, or if no valid line is found, `md5sum' exits with
     nonzero status.  Otherwise, it exits successfully.

`--status'
     This option is useful only when verifying checksums.  When
     verifying checksums, don't generate the default one-line-per-file
     diagnostic and don't output the warning summarizing any failures.
     Failures to open or read a file still evoke individual diagnostics
     to standard error.  If all listed files are readable and are
     consistent with the associated MD5 checksums, exit successfully.
     Otherwise exit with a status code indicating there was a failure.

`-t'
`--text'
     Treat all input files as text files.  This is the reverse of
     `--binary'.

`-w'
`--warn'
     When verifying checksums, warn about improperly formatted MD5
     checksum lines.  This option is useful only if all but a few lines
     in the checked input are valid.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: sort invocation,  Next: uniq invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`sort': Sort text files
=======================

   `sort' sorts, merges, or compares all the lines from the given
files, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.  By
default, `sort' writes the results to standard output.  Synopsis:

     sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `sort' has three modes of operation: sort (the default), merge, and
check for sortedness.  The following options change the operation mode:

`-c'
`--check'
     Check whether the given files are already sorted: if they are not
     all sorted, print an error message and exit with a status of 1.
     Otherwise, exit successfully.

`-m'
`--merge'
     Merge the given files by sorting them as a group.  Each input file
     must always be individually sorted.  It always works to sort
     instead of merge; merging is provided because it is faster, in the
     case where it works.


   A pair of lines is compared as follows: if any key fields have been
specified, `sort' compares each pair of fields, in the order specified
on the command line, according to the associated ordering options,
until a difference is found or no fields are left.  Unless otherwise
specified, all comparisons use the character collating sequence
specified by the `LC_COLLATE' locale.  (1)

   If any of the global options `bdfgiMnr' are given but no key fields
are specified, `sort' compares the entire lines according to the global
options.

   Finally, as a last resort when all keys compare equal (or if no
ordering options were specified at all), `sort' compares the entire
lines.  The last resort comparison honors the `--reverse' (`-r') global
option.  The `--stable' (`-s') option disables this last-resort
comparison so that lines in which all fields compare equal are left in
their original relative order.  If no fields or global options are
specified, `--stable' (`-s') has no effect.

   GNU `sort' (as specified for all GNU utilities) has no limit on
input line length or restrictions on bytes allowed within lines.  In
addition, if the final byte of an input file is not a newline, GNU
`sort' silently supplies one.  A line's trailing newline is not part of
the line for comparison purposes.

   Upon any error, `sort' exits with a status of `2'.

   If the environment variable `TMPDIR' is set, `sort' uses its value
as the directory for temporary files instead of `/tmp'.  The
`--temporary-directory' (`-T') option in turn overrides the environment
variable.

   The following options affect the ordering of output lines.  They may
be specified globally or as part of a specific key field.  If no key
fields are specified, global options apply to comparison of entire
lines; otherwise the global options are inherited by key fields that do
not specify any special options of their own.  In pre-POSIX versions of
`sort', global options affect only later key fields, so portable shell
scripts should specify global options first.

`-b'
`--ignore-leading-blanks'
     Ignore leading blanks when finding sort keys in each line.  The
     `LC_CTYPE' locale determines character types.

`-d'
`--dictionary-order'
     Sort in "phone directory" order: ignore all characters except
     letters, digits and blanks when sorting.  The `LC_CTYPE' locale
     determines character types.

`-f'
`--ignore-case'
     Fold lowercase characters into the equivalent uppercase characters
     when comparing so that, for example, `b' and `B' sort as equal.
     The `LC_CTYPE' locale determines character types.

`-g'
`--general-numeric-sort'
     Sort numerically, using the standard C function `strtod' to convert
     a prefix of each line to a double-precision floating point number.
     This allows floating point numbers to be specified in scientific
     notation, like `1.0e-34' and `10e100'.  The `LC_NUMERIC' locale
     determines the decimal-point character.  Do not report overflow,
     underflow, or conversion errors.  Use the following collating
     sequence:

        * Lines that do not start with numbers (all considered to be
          equal).

        * NaNs ("Not a Number" values, in IEEE floating point
          arithmetic) in a consistent but machine-dependent order.

        * Minus infinity.

        * Finite numbers in ascending numeric order (with -0 and +0
          equal).

        * Plus infinity.

     Use this option only if there is no alternative; it is much slower
     than `--numeric-sort' (`-n') and it can lose information when
     converting to floating point.

`-i'
`--ignore-nonprinting'
     Ignore nonprinting characters.  The `LC_CTYPE' locale determines
     character types.

`-M'
`--month-sort'
     An initial string, consisting of any amount of whitespace, followed
     by a month name abbreviation, is folded to UPPER case and compared
     in the order `JAN' < `FEB' < ... < `DEC'.  Invalid names compare
     low to valid names.  The `LC_TIME' locale category determines the
     month spellings.

`-n'
`--numeric-sort'
     Sort numerically: the number begins each line; specifically, it
     consists of optional whitespace, an optional `-' sign, and zero or
     more digits possibly separated by thousands separators, optionally
     followed by a decimal-point character and zero or more digits.
     The `LC_NUMERIC' locale specifies the decimal-point character and
     thousands separator.

     Numeric sort uses what might be considered an unconventional
     method to compare strings representing floating point numbers.
     Rather than first converting each string to the C `double' type
     and then comparing those values, `sort' aligns the decimal-point
     characters in the two strings and compares the strings a character
     at a time.  One benefit of using this approach is its speed.  In
     practice this is much more efficient than performing the two
     corresponding string-to-double (or even string-to-integer)
     conversions and then comparing doubles.  In addition, there is no
     corresponding loss of precision.  Converting each string to
     `double' before comparison would limit precision to about 16
     digits on most systems.

     Neither a leading `+' nor exponential notation is recognized.  To
     compare such strings numerically, use the `--general-numeric-sort'
     (`-g') option.

`-r'
`--reverse'
     Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key
     values appear earlier in the output instead of later.


   Other options are:

`-o OUTPUT-FILE'
`--output=OUTPUT-FILE'
     Write output to OUTPUT-FILE instead of standard output.  If
     necessary, `sort' reads input before opening OUTPUT-FILE, so you
     can safely sort a file in place by using commands like `sort -o F
     F' and `cat F | sort -o F'.

     On newer systems, `-o' cannot appear after an input file if
     `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set, e.g., `sort F -o F'.  Portable scripts
     should specify `-o OUTPUT-FILE' before any input files.

`-s'
`--stable'
     Make `sort' stable by disabling the last-resort comparison that is
     performed in some cases.  By default, when lines compare equal
     based on command line options that affect ordering, those lines
     are ordered using a "last-resort comparison" that takes the entire
     line as the key and acts as if no ordering options were specified.
     But if `--reverse' (`-r') was specified along with other ordering
     options, then the last-resort comparison does use `--reverse'.  In
     any case, when no ordering option is specified or when only
     `--reverse' is specified, the last-resort comparison is not
     performed

`-S SIZE'
`--buffer-size=SIZE'
     Use a main-memory sort buffer of the given SIZE.  By default, SIZE
     is in units of 1024 bytes.  Appending `%' causes SIZE to be
     interpreted as a percentage of physical memory.  Appending `K'
     multiplies SIZE by 1024 (the default), `M' by 1,048,576, `G' by
     1,073,741,824, and so on for `T', `P', `E', `Z', and `Y'.
     Appending `b' causes SIZE to be interpreted as a byte count, with
     no multiplication.

     This option can improve the performance of `sort' by causing it to
     start with a larger or smaller sort buffer than the default.
     However, this option affects only the initial buffer size.  The
     buffer grows beyond SIZE if `sort' encounters input lines larger
     than SIZE.

`-t SEPARATOR'
`--field-separator=SEPARATOR'
     Use character SEPARATOR as the field separator when finding the
     sort keys in each line.  By default, fields are separated by the
     empty string between a non-whitespace character and a whitespace
     character.  That is, given the input line ` foo bar', `sort'
     breaks it into fields ` foo' and ` bar'.  The field separator is
     not considered to be part of either the field preceding or the
     field following.  But note that sort fields that extend to the end
     of the line, as `-k 2', or sort fields consisting of a range, as
     `-k 2,3', retain the field separators present between the
     endpoints of the range.

`-T TEMPDIR'
`--temporary-directory=TEMPDIR'
     Use directory TEMPDIR to store temporary files, overriding the
     `TMPDIR' environment variable.  If this option is given more than
     once, temporary files are stored in all the directories given.  If
     you have a large sort or merge that is I/O-bound, you can often
     improve performance by using this option to specify directories on
     different disks and controllers.

`-u'
`--unique'
     Normally, output only the first of a sequence of lines that compare
     equal.  For the `--check' (`-c') option, check that no pair of
     consecutive lines compares equal.

`-k POS1[,POS2]'
`--key=POS1[,POS2]'
     Specify a sort field that consists of the part of the line between
     POS1 and POS2 (or the end of the line, if POS2 is omitted),
     _inclusive_.  Fields and character positions are numbered starting
     with 1.  So to sort on the second field, you'd use `--key=2,2'
     (`-k 2,2').  See below for more examples.

`-z'
`--zero-terminated'
     Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte
     (ASCII NUL (Null) character) instead of an ASCII LF (Line Feed).
     This option can be useful in conjunction with `perl -0' or `find
     -print0' and `xargs -0' which do the same in order to reliably
     handle arbitrary pathnames (even those which contain Line Feed
     characters.)


   Historical (BSD and System V) implementations of `sort' have
differed in their interpretation of some options, particularly `-b',
`-f', and `-n'.  GNU sort follows the POSIX behavior, which is usually
(but not always!) like the System V behavior.  According to POSIX, `-n'
no longer implies `-b'.  For consistency, `-M' has been changed in the
same way.  This may affect the meaning of character positions in field
specifications in obscure cases.  The only fix is to add an explicit
`-b'.

   A position in a sort field specified with the `-k' option has the
form `F.C', where F is the number of the field to use and C is the
number of the first character from the beginning of the field.  In a
start position, an omitted `.C' stands for the field's first character.
In an end position, an omitted or zero `.C' stands for the field's
last character.  If the `-b' option was specified, the `.C' part of a
field specification is counted from the first nonblank character of the
field.

   A sort key position may also have any of the option letters `Mbdfinr'
appended to it, in which case the global ordering options are not used
for that particular field.  The `-b' option may be independently
attached to either or both of the start and end positions of a field
specification, and if it is inherited from the global options it will
be attached to both.  Keys may span multiple fields.

   On older systems, `sort' supports an obsolete origin-zero syntax
`+POS1 [-POS2]' for specifying sort keys.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note
Standards conformance::) does not allow this; use `-k' instead.

   Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options.

   * Sort in descending (reverse) numeric order.

          sort -nr

   * Sort alphabetically, omitting the first and second fields.  This
     uses a single key composed of the characters beginning at the
     start of field three and extending to the end of each line.

          sort -k 3

   * Sort numerically on the second field and resolve ties by sorting
     alphabetically on the third and fourth characters of field five.
     Use `:' as the field delimiter.

          sort -t : -k 2,2n -k 5.3,5.4

     Note that if you had written `-k 2' instead of `-k 2,2' `sort'
     would have used all characters beginning in the second field and
     extending to the end of the line as the primary _numeric_ key.
     For the large majority of applications, treating keys spanning
     more than one field as numeric will not do what you expect.

     Also note that the `n' modifier was applied to the field-end
     specifier for the first key.  It would have been equivalent to
     specify `-k 2n,2' or `-k 2n,2n'.  All modifiers except `b' apply
     to the associated _field_, regardless of whether the modifier
     character is attached to the field-start and/or the field-end part
     of the key specifier.

   * Sort the password file on the fifth field and ignore any leading
     white space.  Sort lines with equal values in field five on the
     numeric user ID in field three.

          sort -t : -k 5b,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd

     An alternative is to use the global numeric modifier `-n'.

          sort -t : -n -k 5b,5 -k 3,3 /etc/passwd

   * Generate a tags file in case-insensitive sorted order.

          find src -type f -print0 | sort -t / -z -f | xargs -0 etags --append

     The use of `-print0', `-z', and `-0' in this case means that
     pathnames that contain Line Feed characters will not get broken up
     by the sort operation.

     Finally, to ignore both leading and trailing white space, you
     could have applied the `b' modifier to the field-end specifier for
     the first key,

          sort -t : -n -k 5b,5b -k 3,3 /etc/passwd

     or by using the global `-b' modifier instead of `-n' and an
     explicit `n' with the second key specifier.

          sort -t : -b -k 5,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL' to
`en_US'), then `sort' may produce output that is sorted differently
than you're accustomed to.  In that case, set the `LC_ALL' environment
variable to `C'.  Note that setting only `LC_COLLATE' has two problems.
First, it is ineffective if `LC_ALL' is also set.  Second, it has
undefined behavior if `LC_CTYPE' (or `LANG', if `LC_CTYPE' is unset) is
set to an incompatible value.  For example, you get undefined behavior
if `LC_CTYPE' is `ja_JP.PCK' but `LC_COLLATE' is `en_US.UTF-8'.

`uniq': Uniquify files
======================

   `uniq' writes the unique lines in the given `input', or standard
input if nothing is given or for an INPUT name of `-'.  Synopsis:

     uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

   By default, `uniq' prints the unique lines in a sorted file, i.e.,
discards all but one of identical successive lines.  Optionally, it can
instead show only lines that appear exactly once, or lines that appear
more than once.

   The input need not be sorted, but duplicate input lines are detected
only if they are adjacent.  If you want to discard non-adjacent
duplicate lines, perhaps you want to use `sort -u'.

   Comparisons use the character collating sequence specified by the
`LC_COLLATE' locale category.

   If no OUTPUT file is specified, `uniq' writes to standard output.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f N'
`--skip-fields=N'
     Skip N fields on each line before checking for uniqueness.  Fields
     are sequences of non-space non-tab characters that are separated
     from each other by at least one space or tab.

     On older systems, `uniq' supports an obsolete option `-N'.  POSIX
     1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow this;
     use `-f N' instead.

`-s N'
`--skip-chars=N'
     Skip N characters before checking for uniqueness.  If you use both
     the field and character skipping options, fields are skipped over
     first.

     On older systems, `uniq' supports an obsolete option `+N'.  POSIX
     1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow this;
     use `-s N' instead.

`-c'
`--count'
     Print the number of times each line occurred along with the line.

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignore differences in case when comparing lines.

`-d'
`--repeated'
     Print one copy of each duplicate line.

`-D'
`--all-repeated[=DELIMIT-METHOD]'
     Print all copies of each duplicate line.  This option is useful
     mainly in conjunction with other options e.g., to ignore case or
     to compare only selected fields.  The optional DELIMIT-METHOD
     tells how to delimit groups of duplicate lines, and must be one of
     the following:

    `none'
          Do not delimit groups of duplicate lines.  This is equivalent
          to `--all-repeated' (`-D').

    `prepend'
          Output a newline before each group of duplicate lines.

    `separate'
          Separate groups of duplicate lines with a single newline.
          This is the same as using `prepend', except that there is no
          newline before the first group, and hence may be better
          suited for output direct to users.

     Note that when groups are delimited and the input stream contains
     two or more consecutive blank lines, then the output is ambiguous.
     To avoid that, filter the input through `tr -s '\n'' to replace
     each sequence of consecutive newlines with a single newline.

     This is a GNU extension.

`-u'
`--unique'
     Print non-duplicate lines.

`-w N'
`--check-chars=N'
     Compare N characters on each line (after skipping any specified
     fields and characters).  By default the entire rest of the lines
     are compared.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: comm invocation,  Next: ptx invocation,  Prev: uniq invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`comm': Compare two sorted files line by line
=============================================

   `comm' writes to standard output lines that are common, and lines
that are unique, to two input files; a file name of `-' means standard
input.  Synopsis:

     comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

   Before `comm' can be used, the input files must be sorted using the
collating sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE' locale.  If an input
file ends in a non-newline character, a newline is silently appended.
The `sort' command with no options always outputs a file that is
suitable input to `comm'.

   With no options, `comm' produces three column output.  Column one
contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to
FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.  Columns
are separated by a single TAB character.

   The options `-1', `-2', and `-3' suppress printing of the
corresponding columns.  Also see *Note Common options::.

   Unlike some other comparison utilities, `comm' has an exit status
that does not depend on the result of the comparison.  Upon normal
completion `comm' produces an exit code of zero.  If there is an error
it exits with nonzero status.

`tsort': Topological sort
=========================

   `tsort' performs a topological sort on the given FILE, or standard
input if no input file is given or for a FILE of `-'.  For more details
and some history, see *Note tsort background::.  Synopsis:

     tsort [OPTION] [FILE]

   `tsort' reads its input as pairs of strings, separated by blanks,
indicating a partial ordering.  The output is a total ordering that
corresponds to the given partial ordering.

   For example

     tsort <<EOF
     a b c
     d
     e f
     b c d e
     EOF

will produce the output

     a
     b
     c
     d
     e
     f

   Consider a more realistic example.  You have a large set of
functions all in one file, and they may all be declared static except
one.  Currently that one (say `main') is the first function defined in
the file, and the ones it calls directly follow it, followed by those
they call, etc.  Let's say that you are determined to take advantage of
prototypes, so you have to choose between declaring all of those
functions (which means duplicating a lot of information from the
definitions) and rearranging the functions so that as many as possible
are defined before they are used.  One way to automate the latter
process is to get a list for each function of the functions it calls
directly.  Many programs can generate such lists.  They describe a call
graph.  Consider the following list, in which a given line indicates
that the function on the left calls the one on the right directly.

     main parse_options
     main tail_file
     main tail_forever
     tail_file pretty_name
     tail_file write_header
     tail_file tail
     tail_forever recheck
     tail_forever pretty_name
     tail_forever write_header
     tail_forever dump_remainder
     tail tail_lines
     tail tail_bytes
     tail_lines start_lines
     tail_lines dump_remainder
     tail_lines file_lines
     tail_lines pipe_lines
     tail_bytes xlseek
     tail_bytes start_bytes
     tail_bytes dump_remainder
     tail_bytes pipe_bytes
     file_lines dump_remainder
     recheck pretty_name

   then you can use `tsort' to produce an ordering of those functions
that satisfies your requirement.

     example$ tsort call-graph | tac
     dump_remainder
     start_lines
     file_lines
     pipe_lines
     xlseek
     start_bytes
     pipe_bytes
     tail_lines
     tail_bytes
     pretty_name
     write_header
     tail
     recheck
     parse_options
     tail_file
     tail_forever
     main

   `tsort' detects any cycles in the input and writes the first cycle
encountered to standard error.

   Note that for a given partial ordering, generally there is no unique
total ordering.  In the context of the call graph above, the function
`parse_options' may be placed anywhere in the list as long as it
precedes `main'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: tsort background,  Prev: tsort invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`tsort': Background
===================

   `tsort' exists because very early versions of the Unix linker
processed an archive file exactly once, and in order.  As `ld' read
each object in the archive, it decided whether it was needed in the
program based on whether it defined any symbols which were undefined at
that point in the link.

   This meant that dependencies within the archive had to be handled
specially.  For example, `scanf' probably calls `read'.  That means
that in a single pass through an archive, it was important for `scanf.o'
to appear before read.o, because otherwise a program which calls
`scanf' but not `read' might end up with an unexpected unresolved
reference to `read'.

   The way to address this problem was to first generate a set of
dependencies of one object file on another.  This was done by a shell
script called `lorder'.  The GNU tools don't provide a version of
lorder, as far as I know, but you can still find it in BSD
distributions.

   Then you ran `tsort' over the `lorder' output, and you used the
resulting sort to define the order in which you added objects to the
archive.

   This whole procedure has been obsolete since about 1980, because
Unix archives now contain a symbol table (traditionally built by
`ranlib', now generally built by `ar' itself), and the Unix linker uses
the symbol table to effectively make multiple passes over an archive
file.

   Anyhow, that's where tsort came from.  To solve an old problem with
the way the linker handled archive files, which has since been solved
in different ways.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: ptx invocation,  Next: tsort invocation,  Prev: comm invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`ptx': Produce permuted indexes
===============================

   `ptx' reads a text file and essentially produces a permuted index,
with each keyword in its context.  The calling sketch is either one of:

     ptx [OPTION ...] [FILE ...]
     ptx -G [OPTION ...] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

   The `-G' (or its equivalent: `--traditional') option disables all
GNU extensions and reverts to traditional mode, thus introducing some
limitations and changing several of the program's default option values.
When `-G' is not specified, GNU extensions are always enabled.  GNU
extensions to `ptx' are documented wherever appropriate in this
document.  For the full list, see *Note Compatibility in ptx::.

   Individual options are explained in the following sections.

   When GNU extensions are enabled, there may be zero, one or several
FILEs after the options.  If there is no FILE, the program reads the
standard input.  If there is one or several FILEs, they give the name
of input files which are all read in turn, as if all the input files
were concatenated.  However, there is a full contextual break between
each file and, when automatic referencing is requested, file names and
line numbers refer to individual text input files.  In all cases, the
program outputs the permuted index to the standard output.

   When GNU extensions are _not_ enabled, that is, when the program
operates in traditional mode, there may be zero, one or two parameters
besides the options.  If there are no parameters, the program reads the
standard input and outputs the permuted index to the standard output.
If there is only one parameter, it names the text INPUT to be read
instead of the standard input.  If two parameters are given, they give
respectively the name of the INPUT file to read and the name of the
OUTPUT file to produce.  _Be very careful_ to note that, in this case,
the contents of file given by the second parameter is destroyed.  This
behavior is dictated by System V `ptx' compatibility; GNU Standards
normally discourage output parameters not introduced by an option.

   Note that for _any_ file named as the value of an option or as an
input text file, a single dash `-' may be used, in which case standard
input is assumed.  However, it would not make sense to use this
convention more than once per program invocation.

---------------

`-C'
`--copyright'
     Print a short note about the copyright and copying conditions, then

`--traditional'
     As already explained, this option disables all GNU extensions to
     `ptx' and switches to traditional mode.

`--help'

Charset selection
-----------------

   As it is set up now, the program assumes that the input file is coded
using 8-bit ISO 8859-1 code, also known as Latin-1 character set,
_unless_ it is compiled for MS-DOS, in which case it uses the character
set of the IBM-PC.  (GNU `ptx' is not known to work on smaller MS-DOS
machines anymore.)  Compared to 7-bit ASCII, the set of characters
which are letters is different; this alters the behavior of regular
expression matching.  Thus, the default regular expression for a
keyword allows foreign or diacriticized letters.  Keyword sorting,
however, is still crude; it obeys the underlying character set ordering
quite blindly.

`-f'
`--ignore-case'
     Fold lower case letters to upper case for sorting.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Input processing in ptx,  Next: Output formatting in ptx,  Prev: Charset selection in ptx,  Up: ptx invocation

Word selection and input processing
-----------------------------------

`-b FILE'

`--break-file=FILE'
     This option provides an alternative (to `-W') method of describing
     which characters make up words.  It introduces the name of a file
     which contains a list of characters which can_not_ be part of one
     word; this file is called the "Break file".  Any character which
     is not part of the Break file is a word constituent.  If both
     options `-b' and `-W' are specified, then `-W' has precedence and
     `-b' is ignored.

     When GNU extensions are enabled, the only way to avoid newline as a
     break character is to write all the break characters in the file
     with no newline at all, not even at the end of the file.  When GNU
     extensions are disabled, spaces, tabs and newlines are always
     considered as break characters even if not included in the Break
     file.

`-i FILE'
`--ignore-file=FILE'
     The file associated with this option contains a list of words
     which will never be taken as keywords in concordance output.  It
     is called the "Ignore file".  The file contains exactly one word
     in each line; the end of line separation of words is not subject
     to the value of the `-S' option.

     There is a default Ignore file used by `ptx' when this option is
     not specified, usually found in `/usr/local/lib/eign' if this has
     not been changed at installation time.  If you want to deactivate
     the default Ignore file, specify `/dev/null' instead.

`-o FILE'
`--only-file=FILE'
     The file associated with this option contains a list of words
     which will be retained in concordance output; any word not
     mentioned in this file is ignored.  The file is called the "Only
     file".  The file contains exactly one word in each line; the end
     of line separation of words is not subject to the value of the
     `-S' option.

     There is no default for the Only file.  When both an Only file and
     an Ignore file are specified, a word is considered a keyword only
     if it is listed in the Only file and not in the Ignore file.

`-r'
`--references'
     On each input line, the leading sequence of non-white space
     characters will be taken to be a reference that has the purpose of
     identifying this input line in the resulting permuted index.  For
     more information about reference production, see *Note Output
     formatting in ptx::.  Using this option changes the default value
     for option `-S'.

     Using this option, the program does not try very hard to remove
     references from contexts in output, but it succeeds in doing so
     _when_ the context ends exactly at the newline.  If option `-r' is
     used with `-S' default value, or when GNU extensions are disabled,
     this condition is always met and references are completely
     excluded from the output contexts.

`-S REGEXP'
`--sentence-regexp=REGEXP'
     This option selects which regular expression will describe the end
     of a line or the end of a sentence.  In fact, this regular
     expression is not the only distinction between end of lines or end
     of sentences, and input line boundaries have no special
     significance outside this option.  By default, when GNU extensions
     are enabled and if `-r' option is not used, end of sentences are
     used.  In this case, this REGEX is imported from GNU Emacs:

          [.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|\t\\|  \\)[ \t\n]*

     Whenever GNU extensions are disabled or if `-r' option is used, end
     of lines are used; in this case, the default REGEXP is just:

          \n

     Using an empty REGEXP is equivalent to completely disabling end of
     line or end of sentence recognition.  In this case, the whole file
     is considered to be a single big line or sentence.  The user might
     want to disallow all truncation flag generation as well, through
     option `-F ""'.  *Note Syntax of Regular Expressions:
     (emacs)Regexps.

     When the keywords happen to be near the beginning of the input
     line or sentence, this often creates an unused area at the
     beginning of the output context line; when the keywords happen to
     be near the end of the input line or sentence, this often creates
     an unused area at the end of the output context line.  The program
     tries to fill those unused areas by wrapping around context in
     them; the tail of the input line or sentence is used to fill the
     unused area on the left of the output line; the head of the input
     line or sentence is used to fill the unused area on the right of
     the output line.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences from the C language are recognized and converted
     to the corresponding characters by `ptx' itself.

`-W REGEXP'
`--word-regexp=REGEXP'
     This option selects which regular expression will describe each
     keyword.  By default, if GNU extensions are enabled, a word is a
     sequence of letters; the REGEXP used is `\w+'.  When GNU
     extensions are disabled, a word is by default anything which ends
     with a space, a tab or a newline; the REGEXP used is `[^ \t\n]+'.

     An empty REGEXP is equivalent to not using this option.  *Note
     Syntax of Regular Expressions: (emacs)Regexps.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and
     converted to the corresponding characters by `ptx' itself.

Output formatting
-----------------

   Output format is mainly controlled by the `-O' and `-T' options
described in the table below.  When neither `-O' nor `-T' are selected,
and if GNU extensions are enabled, the program chooses an output format
suitable for a dumb terminal.  Each keyword occurrence is output to the
center of one line, surrounded by its left and right contexts.  Each
field is properly justified, so the concordance output can be readily
observed.  As a special feature, if automatic references are selected
by option `-A' and are output before the left context, that is, if
option `-R' is _not_ selected, then a colon is added after the
reference; this nicely interfaces with GNU Emacs `next-error'
processing.  In this default output format, each white space character,
like newline and tab, is merely changed to exactly one space, with no
special attempt to compress consecutive spaces.  This might change in
the future.  Except for those white space characters, every other
character of the underlying set of 256 characters is transmitted
verbatim.

   Output format is further controlled by the following options.

`-g NUMBER'
`--gap-size=NUMBER'
     Select the size of the minimum white space gap between the fields
     on the output line.

`-w NUMBER'
`--width=NUMBER'
     Select the maximum output width of each final line.  If references
     are used, they are included or excluded from the maximum output
     width depending on the value of option `-R'.  If this option is not
     selected, that is, when references are output before the left
     context, the maximum output width takes into account the maximum
     length of all references.  If this option is selected, that is,
     when references are output after the right context, the maximum
     output width does not take into account the space taken by
     references, nor the gap that precedes them.

`-A'
`--auto-reference'
     Select automatic references.  Each input line will have an
     automatic reference made up of the file name and the line ordinal,
     with a single colon between them.  However, the file name will be
     empty when standard input is being read.  If both `-A' and `-r'
     are selected, then the input reference is still read and skipped,
     but the automatic reference is used at output time, overriding the
     input reference.

`-R'
`--right-side-refs'
     In the default output format, when option `-R' is not used, any
     references produced by the effect of options `-r' or `-A' are
     placed to the far right of output lines, after the right context.
     With default output format, when the `-R' option is specified,
     references are rather placed at the beginning of each output line,
     before the left context.  For any other output format, option `-R'
     is ignored, with one exception:  with `-R' the width of references
     is _not_ taken into account in total output width given by `-w'.

     This option is automatically selected whenever GNU extensions are
     disabled.

`-F STRING'
`--flac-truncation=STRING'
     This option will request that any truncation in the output be
     reported using the string STRING.  Most output fields
     theoretically extend towards the beginning or the end of the
     current line, or current sentence, as selected with option `-S'.
     But there is a maximum allowed output line width, changeable
     through option `-w', which is further divided into space for
     various output fields.  When a field has to be truncated because
     it cannot extend beyond the beginning or the end of the current
     line to fit in, then a truncation occurs.  By default, the string
     used is a single slash, as in `-F /'.

     STRING may have more than one character, as in `-F ...'.  Also, in
     the particular case when STRING is empty (`-F ""'), truncation
     flagging is disabled, and no truncation marks are appended in this
     case.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and
     converted to the corresponding characters by `ptx' itself.

`-M STRING'
`--macro-name=STRING'
     Select another STRING to be used instead of `xx', while generating
     output suitable for `nroff', `troff' or TeX.

`-O'
`--format=roff'
     Choose an output format suitable for `nroff' or `troff'
     processing.  Each output line will look like:

          .xx "TAIL" "BEFORE" "KEYWORD_AND_AFTER" "HEAD" "REF"

     so it will be possible to write a `.xx' roff macro to take care of
     the output typesetting.  This is the default output format when GNU
     extensions are disabled.  Option `-M' can be used to change `xx'
     to another macro name.

     In this output format, each non-graphical character, like newline
     and tab, is merely changed to exactly one space, with no special
     attempt to compress consecutive spaces.  Each quote character: `"'
     is doubled so it will be correctly processed by `nroff' or `troff'.

`-T'
`--format=tex'
     Choose an output format suitable for TeX processing.  Each output
     line will look like:

          \xx {TAIL}{BEFORE}{KEYWORD}{AFTER}{HEAD}{REF}

     so it will be possible to write a `\xx' definition to take care of
     the output typesetting.  Note that when references are not being
     produced, that is, neither option `-A' nor option `-r' is
     selected, the last parameter of each `\xx' call is inhibited.
     Option `-M' can be used to change `xx' to another macro name.

     In this output format, some special characters, like `$', `%',
     `&', `#' and `_' are automatically protected with a backslash.
     Curly brackets `{', `}' are protected with a backslash and a pair
     of dollar signs (to force mathematical mode).  The backslash
     itself produces the sequence `\backslash{}'.  Circumflex and tilde
     diacritical marks produce the sequence `^\{ }' and `~\{ }'
     respectively.  Other diacriticized characters of the underlying
     character set produce an appropriate TeX sequence as far as
     possible.  The other non-graphical characters, like newline and
     tab, and all other characters which are not part of ASCII, are
     merely changed to exactly one space, with no special attempt to
     compress consecutive spaces.  Let me know how to improve this
     special character processing for TeX.

The GNU extensions to `ptx'
---------------------------

   This version of `ptx' contains a few features which do not exist in
System V `ptx'.  These extra features are suppressed by using the `-G'
command line option, unless overridden by other command line options.
Some GNU extensions cannot be recovered by overriding, so the simple
rule is to avoid `-G' if you care about GNU extensions.  Here are the
differences between this program and System V `ptx'.

   * This program can read many input files at once, it always writes
     the resulting concordance on standard output.  On the other hand,
     System V `ptx' reads only one file and sends the result to
     standard output or, if a second FILE parameter is given on the
     command, to that FILE.

     Having output parameters not introduced by options is a dangerous
     practice which GNU avoids as far as possible.  So, for using `ptx'
     portably between GNU and System V, you should always use it with a
     single input file, and always expect the result on standard
     output.  You might also want to automatically configure in a `-G'
     option to `ptx' calls in products using `ptx', if the configurator
     finds that the installed `ptx' accepts `-G'.

   * The only options available in System V `ptx' are options `-b',
     `-f', `-g', `-i', `-o', `-r', `-t' and `-w'.  All other options
     are GNU extensions and are not repeated in this enumeration.
     Moreover, some options have a slightly different meaning when GNU
     extensions are enabled, as explained below.

   * By default, concordance output is not formatted for `troff' or
     `nroff'.  It is rather formatted for a dumb terminal.  `troff' or
     `nroff' output may still be selected through option `-O'.

   * Unless `-R' option is used, the maximum reference width is
     subtracted from the total output line width.  With GNU extensions
     disabled, width of references is not taken into account in the
     output line width computations.

   * All 256 characters, even `NUL's, are always read and processed from
     input file with no adverse effect, even if GNU extensions are
     disabled.  However, System V `ptx' does not accept 8-bit
     characters, a few control characters are rejected, and the tilde
     `~' is also rejected.

   * Input line length is only limited by available memory, even if GNU
     extensions are disabled.  However, System V `ptx' processes only
     the first 200 characters in each line.

   * The break (non-word) characters default to be every character
     except all letters of the underlying character set, diacriticized
     or not.  When GNU extensions are disabled, the break characters
     default to space, tab and newline only.

   * The program makes better use of output line width.  If GNU
     extensions are disabled, the program rather tries to imitate
     System V `ptx', but still, there are some slight disposition
     glitches this program does not completely reproduce.

   * The user can specify both an Ignore file and an Only file.  This
     is not allowed with System V `ptx'.

`cut': Print selected parts of lines
====================================

   `cut' writes to standard output selected parts of each line of each
input file, or standard input if no files are given or for a file name
of `-'.  Synopsis:

     cut [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   In the table which follows, the BYTE-LIST, CHARACTER-LIST, and
FIELD-LIST are one or more numbers or ranges (two numbers separated by
a dash) separated by commas.  Bytes, characters, and fields are
numbered starting at 1.  Incomplete ranges may be given: `-M' means
`1-M'; `N-' means `N' through end of line or last field.  The list
elements can be repeated, can overlap, and can be specified in any
order; but the selected input is written in the same order that it is
read, and is written exactly once.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b BYTE-LIST'
`--bytes=BYTE-LIST'
     Print only the bytes in positions listed in BYTE-LIST.  Tabs and
     backspaces are treated like any other character; they take up 1
     byte.  If an output delimiter is specified, (see the description of
     `--output-delimiter'), then output that string between ranges of
     selected bytes.

`-c CHARACTER-LIST'
`--characters=CHARACTER-LIST'
     Print only characters in positions listed in CHARACTER-LIST.  The
     same as `-b' for now, but internationalization will change that.
     Tabs and backspaces are treated like any other character; they
     take up 1 character.  If an output delimiter is specified, (see
     the description of `--output-delimiter'), then output that string
     between ranges of selected bytes.

`-f FIELD-LIST'
`--fields=FIELD-LIST'
     Print only the fields listed in FIELD-LIST.  Fields are separated
     by a TAB character by default.  Also print any line that contains
     no delimiter character, unless the `--only-delimited' (`-s')
     option is specified

`-d INPUT_DELIM_BYTE'
`--delimiter=INPUT_DELIM_BYTE'
     For `-f', fields are separated in the input by the first character
     in INPUT_DELIM_BYTE (default is TAB).

`-n'
     Do not split multi-byte characters (no-op for now).

`-s'
`--only-delimited'
     For `-f', do not print lines that do not contain the field
     separator character.  Normally, any line without a field separator
     is printed verbatim.

`--output-delimiter=OUTPUT_DELIM_STRING'
     With `-f', output fields are separated by OUTPUT_DELIM_STRING.
     The default with `-f' is to use the input delimiter.  When using
     `-b' or `-c' to select ranges of byte or character offsets (as
     opposed to ranges of fields), output OUTPUT_DELIM_STRING between
     ranges of selected bytes.

`paste': Merge lines of files
=============================

   `paste' writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially
corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.
Standard input is used for a file name of `-' or if no input files are
given.

   For example:

     $ cat num2
     1
     2
     $ cat let3
     a
     b
     c
     $ paste num2 let3
     1       a
     2       b
             c

   Synopsis:

     paste [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-s'
`--serial'
     Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from
     each file.  Using the above example data:

          $ paste -s num2 let3
          1       2
          a       b       c

`-d DELIM-LIST'
`--delimiters=DELIM-LIST'
     Consecutively use the characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to
     separate merged lines.  When DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again
     at its beginning.  Using the above example data:

          $ paste -d '%_' num2 let3 num2
          1%a_1
          2%b_2
          %c_



File: coreutils.info,  Node: join invocation,  Prev: paste invocation,  Up: Operating on fields within a line

`join': Join lines on a common field
====================================

   `join' writes to standard output a line for each pair of input lines
that have identical join fields.  Synopsis:

     join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

   Either FILE1 or FILE2 (but not both) can be `-', meaning standard
input.  FILE1 and FILE2 should be sorted on the join fields.

   Normally, the sort order is that of the collating sequence specified
by the `LC_COLLATE' locale.  Unless the `-t' option is given, the sort
comparison ignores blanks at the start of the join field, as in `sort
-b'.  If the `--ignore-case' option is given, the sort comparison
ignores the case of characters in the join field, as in `sort -f'.

   However, as a GNU extension, if the input has no unpairable lines the
sort order can be any order that considers two fields to be equal if and
only if the sort comparison described above considers them to be equal.
For example:

     $ cat file1
     a a1
     c c1
     b b1
     $ cat file2
     a a2
     c c2
     b b2
     $ join file1 file2
     a a1 a2
     c c1 c2
     b b1 b2

   The defaults are: the join field is the first field in each line;
fields in the input are separated by one or more blanks, with leading
blanks on the line ignored; fields in the output are separated by a
space; each output line consists of the join field, the remaining
fields from FILE1, then the remaining fields from FILE2.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a FILE-NUMBER'
     Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either
     `1' or `2'), in addition to the normal output.

`-e STRING'
     Replace those output fields that are missing in the input with
     STRING.

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignore differences in case when comparing keys.  With this option,
     the lines of the input files must be ordered in the same way.  Use
     `sort -f' to produce this ordering.

`-1 FIELD'
`-j1 FIELD'
     Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 1.

`-2 FIELD'
`-j2 FIELD'
     Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 2.

`-j FIELD'
     Equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'.

`-o FIELD-LIST...'
     Construct each output line according to the format in FIELD-LIST.
     Each element in FIELD-LIST is either the single character `0' or
     has the form M.N where the file number, M, is `1' or `2' and N is
     a positive field number.

     A field specification of `0' denotes the join field.  In most
     cases, the functionality of the `0' field spec may be reproduced
     using the explicit M.N that corresponds to the join field.
     However, when printing unpairable lines (using either of the `-a'
     or `-v' options), there is no way to specify the join field using
     M.N in FIELD-LIST if there are unpairable lines in both files.  To
     give `join' that functionality, POSIX invented the `0' field
     specification notation.

     The elements in FIELD-LIST are separated by commas or blanks.
     Multiple FIELD-LIST arguments can be given after a single `-o'
     option; the values of all lists given with `-o' are concatenated
     together.  All output lines - including those printed because of
     any -a or -v option - are subject to the specified FIELD-LIST.

`-t CHAR'
     Use character CHAR as the input and output field separator.

`-v FILE-NUMBER'
     Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either
     `1' or `2'), instead of the normal output.


   In addition, when GNU `join' is invoked with exactly one argument,
the `--help' and `--version' options are recognized.  *Note Common
options::.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: Character sets,  Next: Translating,  Up: tr invocation

Specifying sets of characters
-----------------------------

   The format of the SET1 and SET2 arguments resembles the format of
regular expressions; however, they are not regular expressions, only
lists of characters.  Most characters simply represent themselves in
these strings, but the strings can contain the shorthands listed below,
for convenience.  Some of them can be used only in SET1 or SET2, as
noted below.

Backslash escapes
     A backslash followed by a character not listed below causes an
     error message.

    `\a'
          Control-G.

    `\b'
          Control-H.

    `\f'
          Control-L.

    `\n'
          Control-J.

    `\r'
          Control-M.

    `\t'
          Control-I.

    `\v'
          Control-K.

    `\OOO'
          The character with the value given by OOO, which is 1 to 3
          octal digits,

    `\\'
          A backslash.

Ranges
     The notation `M-N' expands to all of the characters from M through
     N, in ascending order.  M should collate before N; if it doesn't,
     an error results.  As an example, `0-9' is the same as
     `0123456789'.

     GNU `tr' does not support the System V syntax that uses square
     brackets to enclose ranges.  Translations specified in that format
     sometimes work as expected, since the brackets are often
     transliterated to themselves.  However, they should be avoided
     because they sometimes behave unexpectedly.  For example, `tr -d
     '[0-9]'' deletes brackets as well as digits.

     Many historically common and even accepted uses of ranges are not
     portable.  For example, on EBCDIC hosts using the `A-Z' range will
     not do what most would expect because `A' through `Z' are not
     contiguous as they are in ASCII.  If you can rely on a POSIX
     compliant version of `tr', then the best way to work around this
     is to use character classes (see below).  Otherwise, it is most
     portable (and most ugly) to enumerate the members of the ranges.

Repeated characters
     The notation `[C*N]' in SET2 expands to N copies of character C.
     Thus, `[y*6]' is the same as `yyyyyy'.  The notation `[C*]' in
     STRING2 expands to as many copies of C as are needed to make SET2
     as long as SET1.  If N begins with `0', it is interpreted in
     octal, otherwise in decimal.

Character classes
     The notation `[:CLASS:]' expands to all of the characters in the
     (predefined) class CLASS.  The characters expand in no particular
     order, except for the `upper' and `lower' classes, which expand in
     ascending order.  When the `--delete' (`-d') and
     `--squeeze-repeats' (`-s') options are both given, any character
     class can be used in SET2.  Otherwise, only the character classes
     `lower' and `upper' are accepted in SET2, and then only if the
     corresponding character class (`upper' and `lower', respectively)
     is specified in the same relative position in SET1.  Doing this
     specifies case conversion.  The class names are given below; an
     error results when an invalid class name is given.

    `alnum'
          Letters and digits.

    `alpha'
          Letters.

    `blank'
          Horizontal whitespace.

    `cntrl'
          Control characters.

    `digit'
          Digits.

    `graph'
          Printable characters, not including space.

    `lower'
          Lowercase letters.

    `print'
          Printable characters, including space.

    `punct'
          Punctuation characters.

    `space'
          Horizontal or vertical whitespace.

    `upper'
          Uppercase letters.

    `xdigit'
          Hexadecimal digits.

Equivalence classes
     The syntax `[=C=]' expands to all of the characters that are
     equivalent to C, in no particular order.  Equivalence classes are
     a relatively recent invention intended to support non-English
     alphabets.  But there seems to be no standard way to define them
     or determine their contents.  Therefore, they are not fully
     implemented in GNU `tr'; each character's equivalence class
     consists only of that character, which is of no particular use.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Translating,  Next: Squeezing,  Prev: Character sets,  Up: tr invocation

Translating
-----------

   `tr' performs translation when SET1 and SET2 are both given and the
`--delete' (`-d') option is not given.  `tr' translates each character
of its input that is in SET1 to the corresponding character in SET2.
Characters not in SET1 are passed through unchanged.  When a character
appears more than once in SET1 and the corresponding characters in SET2
are not all the same, only the final one is used.  For example, these
two commands are equivalent:

     tr aaa xyz
     tr a z

   A common use of `tr' is to convert lowercase characters to
uppercase.  This can be done in many ways.  Here are three of them:

     tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     tr a-z A-Z
     tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'

But note that using ranges like `a-z' above is not portable.

   When `tr' is performing translation, SET1 and SET2 typically have
the same length.  If SET1 is shorter than SET2, the extra characters at
the end of SET2 are ignored.

   On the other hand, making SET1 longer than SET2 is not portable;
POSIX says that the result is undefined.  In this situation, BSD `tr'
pads SET2 to the length of SET1 by repeating the last character of SET2
as many times as necessary.  System V `tr' truncates SET1 to the length
of SET2.

   By default, GNU `tr' handles this case like BSD `tr'.  When the
`--truncate-set1' (`-t') option is given, GNU `tr' handles this case
like the System V `tr' instead.  This option is ignored for operations
other than translation.

   Acting like System V `tr' in this case breaks the relatively common
BSD idiom:

     tr -cs A-Za-z0-9 '\012'

because it converts only zero bytes (the first element in the
complement of SET1), rather than all non-alphanumerics, to newlines.

By the way, the above idiom is not portable because it uses ranges.
Assuming a POSIX compliant `tr', here is a better way to write it:

     tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'

Squeezing repeats and deleting
------------------------------

   When given just the `--delete' (`-d') option, `tr' removes any input
characters that are in SET1.

   When given just the `--squeeze-repeats' (`-s') option, `tr' replaces
each input sequence of a repeated character that is in SET1 with a
single occurrence of that character.

   When given both `--delete' and `--squeeze-repeats', `tr' first
performs any deletions using SET1, then squeezes repeats from any
remaining characters using SET2.

   The `--squeeze-repeats' option may also be used when translating, in
which case `tr' first performs translation, then squeezes repeats from
any remaining characters using SET2.

   Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options:

   * Remove all zero bytes:

          tr -d '\000'

   * Put all words on lines by themselves.  This converts all
     non-alphanumeric characters to newlines, then squeezes each string
     of repeated newlines into a single newline:

          tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'

   * Convert each sequence of repeated newlines to a single newline:

          tr -s '\n'

   * Find doubled occurrences of words in a document.  For example,
     people often write "the the" with the duplicated words separated
     by a newline.  The bourne shell script below works first by
     converting each sequence of punctuation and blank characters to a
     single newline.  That puts each "word" on a line by itself.  Next
     it maps all uppercase characters to lower case, and finally it
     runs `uniq' with the `-d' option to print out only the words that
     were adjacent duplicates.

          #!/bin/sh
          cat "$@" \
            | tr -s '[:punct:][:blank:]' '\n' \
            | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
            | uniq -d

   * Deleting a small set of characters is usually straightforward.
     For example, to remove all `a's, `x's, and `M's you would do this:

          tr -d axM

     However, when `-' is one of those characters, it can be tricky
     because `-' has special meanings.  Performing the same task as
     above but also removing all `-' characters, we might try `tr -d
     -axM', but that would fail because `tr' would try to interpret
     `-a' as a command-line option.  Alternatively, we could try
     putting the hyphen inside the string, `tr -d a-xM', but that
     wouldn't work either because it would make `tr' interpret `a-x' as
     the range of characters `a'...`x' rather than the three.  One way
     to solve the problem is to put the hyphen at the end of the list
     of characters:

          tr -d axM-

     More generally, use the character class notation `[=c=]' with `-'
     (or any other character) in place of the `c':

          tr -d '[=-=]axM'

     Note how single quotes are used in the above example to protect the
     square brackets from interpretation by a shell.

Warning messages
----------------

   Setting the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT' turns off the
following warning and error messages, for strict compliance with POSIX.
Otherwise, the following diagnostics are issued:

  1. When the `--delete' option is given but `--squeeze-repeats' is
     not, and SET2 is given, GNU `tr' by default prints a usage message
     and exits, because SET2 would not be used.  The POSIX
     specification says that SET2 must be ignored in this case.
     Silently ignoring arguments is a bad idea.

  2. When an ambiguous octal escape is given.  For example, `\400' is
     actually `\40' followed by the digit `0', because the value 400
     octal does not fit into a single byte.


   GNU `tr' does not provide complete BSD or System V compatibility.
For example, it is impossible to disable interpretation of the POSIX
constructs `[:alpha:]', `[=c=]', and `[c*10]'.  Also, GNU `tr' does not
delete zero bytes automatically, unlike traditional Unix versions,
which provide no way to preserve zero bytes.

`expand': Convert tabs to spaces
================================

   `expand' writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input
if none are given or for a FILE of `-', to standard output, with tab
characters converted to the appropriate number of spaces.  Synopsis:

     expand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `expand' converts all tabs to spaces.  It preserves
backspace characters in the output; they decrement the column count for
tab calculations.  The default action is equivalent to `-t 8' (set tabs
every 8 columns).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-t TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`--tabs=TAB1[,TAB2]...'
     If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart
     (default is 8).  Otherwise, set the tabs at columns TAB1, TAB2,
     ... (numbered from 0), and replace any tabs beyond the last
     tabstop given with single spaces.  Tabstops can be separated by
     blanks as well as by commas.

     On older systems, `expand' supports an obsolete option
     `-TAB1[,TAB2]...', where tabstops must be separated by commas.
     POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow
     this; use `-t TAB1[,TAB2]...' instead.

`-i'
`--initial'
     Only convert initial tabs (those that precede all non-space or
     non-tab characters) on each line to spaces.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: unexpand invocation,  Prev: expand invocation,  Up: Operating on characters

`unexpand': Convert spaces to tabs
==================================

   `unexpand' writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input
if none are given or for a FILE of `-', to standard output, with
strings of two or more space or tab characters converted to as many
tabs as possible followed by as many spaces as are needed.  Synopsis:

     unexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `unexpand' converts only initial spaces and tabs (those
that precede all non space or tab characters) on each line.  It
preserves backspace characters in the output; they decrement the column
count for tab calculations.  By default, tabs are set at every 8th
column.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-t TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`--tabs=TAB1[,TAB2]...'
     If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart
     instead of the default 8.  Otherwise, set the tabs at columns
     TAB1, TAB2, ... (numbered from 0), and leave spaces and tabs
     beyond the tabstops given unchanged.  Tabstops can be separated by
     blanks as well as by commas.  This option implies the `-a' option.

     On older systems, `unexpand' supports an obsolete option
     `-TAB1[,TAB2]...', where tabstops must be separated by commas.
     (Unlike `-t', this obsolete option does not imply `-a'.)  POSIX
     1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow this;
     use `--first-only -t TAB1[,TAB2]...' instead.

`-a'
`--all'
     Convert all strings of two or more spaces or tabs, not just initial
     ones, to tabs.

`ls': List directory contents
=============================

   The `ls' program lists information about files (of any type,
including directories).  Options and file arguments can be intermixed
arbitrarily, as usual.

   For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by
default `ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and
omitting files with names beginning with `.'.  For other non-option
arguments, by default `ls' lists just the file name.  If no non-option
argument is specified, `ls' operates on the current directory, acting
as if it had been invoked with a single argument of `.'.

   By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the
locale settings in effect. (1) If standard output is a terminal, the
output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control characters are
output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed one per line
and control characters are output as-is.

   Because `ls' is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many
options over the years.  They are described in the subsections below;
within each section, options are listed alphabetically (ignoring case).
The division of options into the subsections is not absolute, since some
options affect more than one aspect of `ls''s operation.

   Also see *Note Common options::.

* Which files are listed::
* What information is listed::

* More details about version sort::
* General output formatting::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL' to
`en_US'), then `ls' may produce output that is sorted differently than
you're accustomed to.  In that case, set the `LC_ALL' environment
variable to `C'.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Which files are listed,  Next: What information is listed,  Up: ls invocation

Which files are listed
----------------------

   These options determine which files `ls' lists information for.  By
default, any files and the contents of any directories on the command
line are shown.

`-a'
`--all'
     List all files in directories, including files that start with `.'.

`-A'
`--almost-all'
     List all files in directories except for `.' and `..'.

`-B'
`--ignore-backups'
     Do not list files that end with `~', unless they are given on the
     command line.

`-d'
`--directory'
     List just the names of directories, as with other types of files,
     rather than listing their contents.  Do not follow symbolic links
     listed on the command line unless the `--dereference-command-line'
     (`-H'), `--dereference' (`-L'), or
     `--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir' options are specified.

`-H'
`--dereference-command-line'
     If a command line argument specifies a symbolic link, show
     information for the file the link references rather than for the
     link itself.

`--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir'
     Do not dereference symbolic links, with one exception: if a
     command line argument specifies a symbolic link that refers to a
     directory, show information for that directory rather than for the
     link itself.  This is the default behavior when no other
     dereferencing-related option has been specified (`--classify'
     (`-F'), `--directory' (`-d'), (`-l'), `--dereference' (`-L'), or
     `--dereference-command-line' (`-H')).

`-I PATTERN'
`--ignore=PATTERN'
     Do not list files whose names match the shell pattern (not regular
     expression) PATTERN unless they are given on the command line.  As
     in the shell, an initial `.' in a file name does not match a
     wildcard at the start of PATTERN.  Sometimes it is useful to give
     this option several times.  For example,

          $ ls --ignore='.??*' --ignore='.[^.]' --ignore='#*'

     The first option ignores names of length 3 or more that start with
     `.', the second ignores all two-character names that start with `.'
     except `..', and the third ignores names that start with `#'.

`-L'
`--dereference'
     When showing file information for a symbolic link, show information
     for the file the link references rather than the link itself.

`-R'
`--recursive'
     List the contents of all directories recursively.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: What information is listed,  Next: Sorting the output,  Prev: Which files are listed,  Up: ls invocation

What information is listed
--------------------------

   These options affect the information that `ls' displays.  By
default, only file names are shown.

`--author'
     List each file's author when producing long format directory
     listings.  In GNU/Hurd, file authors can differ from their owners,
     but in other operating systems the two are the same.

`-D'
`--dired'
     With the long listing (`-l') format, print an additional line after
     the main output:

          //DIRED// BEG1 END1 BEG2 END2 ...

     The BEGN and ENDN are unsigned integers that record the byte
     position of the beginning and end of each file name in the output.
     This makes it easy for Emacs to find the names, even when they
     contain unusual characters such as space or newline, without fancy
     searching.

     If directories are being listed recursively (`-R'), output a
     similar line with offsets for each subdirectory name:
          //SUBDIRED// BEG1 END1 ...

     Finally, output a line of the form:
          //DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=WORD
     where WORD is the quoting style (*note Formatting the file
     names::).

     Here is an actual example:

          $ mkdir -p a/sub/deeper a/sub2
          $ touch a/f1 a/f2
          $ touch a/sub/deeper/file
          $ ls -gloRF --dired a
            a:
            total 8
            -rw-r--r--    1        0 Nov  9 18:30 f1
            -rw-r--r--    1        0 Nov  9 18:30 f2
            drwxr-xr-x    3     4096 Nov  9 18:30 sub/
            drwxr-xr-x    2     4096 Nov  9 18:30 sub2/
          
            a/sub:
            total 4
            drwxr-xr-x    2     4096 Nov  9 18:30 deeper/
          
            a/sub/deeper:
            total 0
            -rw-r--r--    1        0 Nov  9 18:30 file
          
            a/sub2:
            total 0
          //DIRED// 55 57 98 100 141 144 186 190 252 258 327 331
          //SUBDIRED// 2 3 195 200 263 275 335 341
          //DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=literal

     Note that the pairs of offsets on the `//DIRED//' line above
     delimit these names: `f1', `f2', `sub', `sub2', `deeper', `file'.
     The offsets on the `//SUBDIRED//' line delimit the following
     directory names: `a', `a/sub', `a/sub/deeper', `a/sub2'.

     Here is an example of how to extract the fifth entry name,
     `deeper', corresponding to the pair of offsets, 252 and 258:

          $ ls -gloRF --dired a > out
          $ dd bs=1 skip=252 count=6 < out 2>/dev/null; echo
          deeper

     Note that although the listing above includes a trailing slash for
     the `deeper' entry, the offsets select the name without the
     trailing slash.  However, if you invoke `ls' with `--dired' along
     with an option like `--escape' (aka `-b') and operate on a file
     whose name contains special characters, notice that the backslash
     _is_ included:

          $ touch 'a b'
          $ ls -blog --dired 'a b'
            -rw-r--r--    1        0 Nov  9 18:41 a\ b
          //DIRED// 40 44
          //DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=escape

     If you use a quoting style that adds quote marks (e.g.,
     `--quoting-style=c'), then the offsets include the quote marks.
     So beware that the user may select the quoting style via the
     environment variable `QUOTING_STYLE'.  Hence, applications using
     `--dired' should either specify an explicit
     `--quoting-style=literal' option (aka `-N' or `--literal') on the
     command line, or else be prepared to parse the escaped names.

`--full-time'
     Produce long format directory listings, and list times in full.
     It is equivalent to using `--format=long' with
     `--time-style=full-iso' (*note Formatting file timestamps::).

`-g'
     Produce long format directory listings, but don't display owner
     information.

`-G'
`--no-group'
     Inhibit display of group information in a long format directory
     listing.  (This is the default in some non-GNU versions of `ls',
     so we provide this option for compatibility.)

`-h'
`--human-readable'
     Append a size letter to each size, such as `M' for mebibytes.
     Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; `M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
     This option is equivalent to `--block-size=human' (*note Block
     size::).  Use the `--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

`-i'
`--inode'
     Print the inode number (also called the file serial number and
     index number) of each file to the left of the file name.  (This
     number uniquely identifies each file within a particular
     filesystem.)

`-l'
`--format=long'
`--format=verbose'
     In addition to the name of each file, print the file type,
     permissions, number of hard links, owner name, group name, size,
     and timestamp (*note Formatting file timestamps::), normally the
     modification time.

     Normally the size is printed as a byte count without punctuation,
     but this can be overridden (*note Block size::).  For example, `-h'
     prints an abbreviated, human-readable count, and
     `--block-size="'1"' prints a byte count with the thousands
     separator of the current locale.

     For each directory that is listed, preface the files with a line
     `total BLOCKS', where BLOCKS is the total disk allocation for all
     files in that directory.  The block size currently defaults to 1024
     bytes, but this can be overridden (*note Block size::).  The
     BLOCKS computed counts each hard link separately; this is arguably
     a deficiency.

     The permissions listed are similar to symbolic mode specifications
     (*note Symbolic Modes::).  But `ls' combines multiple bits into the
     third character of each set of permissions as follows:
    `s'
          If the setuid or setgid bit and the corresponding executable
          bit are both set.

    `S'
          If the setuid or setgid bit is set but the corresponding
          executable bit is not set.

    `t'
          If the sticky bit and the other-executable bit are both set.

    `T'
          If the sticky bit is set but the other-executable bit is not
          set.

    `x'
          If the executable bit is set and none of the above apply.

    `-'
          Otherwise.

     Following the permission bits is a single character that specifies
     whether an alternate access method applies to the file.  When that
     character is a space, there is no alternate access method.  When it
     is a printing character (e.g., `+'), then there is such a method.

`-n'
`--numeric-uid-gid'
     Produce long format directory listings, but display numeric UIDs
     and GIDs instead of the owner and group names.

`-o'
     Produce long format directory listings, but don't display group
     information.  It is equivalent to using `--format=long' with
     `--no-group' .

`-s'
`--size'
     Print the disk allocation of each file to the left of the file
     name.  This is the amount of disk space used by the file, which is
     usually a bit more than the file's size, but it can be less if the
     file has holes.

     Normally the disk allocation is printed in units of 1024 bytes,
     but this can be overridden (*note Block size::).

     For files that are NFS-mounted from an HP-UX system to a BSD
     system, this option reports sizes that are half the correct
     values.  On HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are twice the
     correct values for files that are NFS-mounted from BSD systems.
     This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also affects the HP-UX `ls'
     program.

`--si'
     Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as `MB' for
     megabytes.  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; `MB' stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  This option is equivalent to `--block-size=si'.
     Use the `-h' or `--human-readable' option if you prefer powers of
     1024.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Sorting the output,  Next: More details about version sort,  Prev: What information is listed,  Up: ls invocation

Sorting the output
------------------

   These options change the order in which `ls' sorts the information
it outputs.  By default, sorting is done by character code (e.g., ASCII
order).

`-c'
`--time=ctime'
`--time=status'
`--time=use'
     If the long listing format (e.g., `-l', `-o') is being used, print
     the status change time (the `ctime' in the inode) instead of the
     modification time.  When explicitly sorting by time (`--sort=time'
     or `-t') or when not using a long listing format, sort according
     to the status change time.

`-f'
     Primarily, like `-U'--do not sort; list the files in whatever
     order they are stored in the directory.  But also enable `-a' (list
     all files) and disable `-l', `--color', and `-s' (if they were
     specified before the `-f').

`-r'
`--reverse'
     Reverse whatever the sorting method is--e.g., list files in reverse
     alphabetical order, youngest first, smallest first, or whatever.

`-S'
`--sort=size'
     Sort by file size, largest first.

`-t'
`--sort=time'
     Sort by modification time (the `mtime' in the inode), newest first.

`-u'
`--time=atime'
`--time=access'
     If the long listing format (e.g., `--format=long') is being used,
     print the last access time (the `atime' in the inode).  When
     explicitly sorting by time (`--sort=time' or `-t') or when not
     using a long listing format, sort according to the access time.

`-U'
`--sort=none'
     Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in
     the directory.  (Do not do any of the other unrelated things that
     `-f' does.)  This is especially useful when listing very large
     directories, since not doing any sorting can be noticeably faster.

`-v'
`--sort=version'
     Sort by version name and number, lowest first.  It behaves like a
     default sort, except that each sequence of decimal digits is
     treated numerically as an index/version number.  (*Note More
     details about version sort::.)

`-X'
`--sort=extension'
     Sort directory contents alphabetically by file extension
     (characters after the last `.'); files with no extension are
     sorted first.

More details about version sort
-------------------------------

   The version sort takes into account the fact that file names
frequently include indices or version numbers.  Standard sorting
functions usually do not produce the ordering that people expect
because comparisons are made on a character-by-character basis.  The
version sort addresses this problem, and is especially useful when
browsing directories that contain many files with indices/version
numbers in their names:

           > ls -1            > ls -1v
           foo.zml-1.gz       foo.zml-1.gz
           foo.zml-100.gz     foo.zml-2.gz
           foo.zml-12.gz      foo.zml-6.gz
           foo.zml-13.gz      foo.zml-12.gz
           foo.zml-2.gz       foo.zml-13.gz
           foo.zml-25.gz      foo.zml-25.gz
           foo.zml-6.gz       foo.zml-100.gz

   Note also that numeric parts with leading zeroes are considered as
fractional one:

           > ls -1            > ls -1v
           abc-1.007.tgz      abc-1.007.tgz
           abc-1.012b.tgz     abc-1.01a.tgz
           abc-1.01a.tgz      abc-1.012b.tgz

General output formatting
-------------------------

   These options affect the appearance of the overall output.

`-1'
`--format=single-column'
     List one file per line.  This is the default for `ls' when standard
     output is not a terminal.

`-C'
`--format=vertical'
     List files in columns, sorted vertically.  This is the default for
     `ls' if standard output is a terminal.  It is always the default
     for the `dir' and `d' programs.  GNU `ls' uses variable width
     columns to display as many files as possible in the fewest lines.

`--color [=WHEN]'
     Specify whether to use color for distinguishing file types.  WHEN
     may be omitted, or one of:
        * none - Do not use color at all.  This is the default.

        * auto - Only use color if standard output is a terminal.

        * always - Always use color.
     Specifying `--color' and no WHEN is equivalent to `--color=always'.
     Piping a colorized listing through a pager like `more' or `less'
     usually produces unreadable results.  However, using `more -f'
     does seem to work.

`-F'
`--classify'
`--indicator-style=classify'
     Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
     Also, for regular files that are executable, append `*'.  The file
     type indicators are `/' for directories, `@' for symbolic links,
     `|' for FIFOs, `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular files.  Do
     not follow symbolic links listed on the command line unless the
     `--dereference-command-line' (`-H'), `--dereference' (`-L'), or
     `--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir' options are specified.

`--indicator-style=WORD'
     Append a character indicator with style WORD to entry names, as
     follows:
    `none'
          Do not append any character indicator; this is the default.

    `file-type'
          Append `/' for directories, `@' for symbolic links, `|' for
          FIFOs, `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular files.  This
          is the same as the `-p' or `--file-type' option.

    `classify'
          Append `*' for executable regular files, otherwise behave as
          for `file-type'.  This is the same as the `-F' or
          `--classify' option.

`-k'
     Print file sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block
     size (*note Block size::).  This option is equivalent to
     `--block-size=1K'.

`-m'
`--format=commas'
     List files horizontally, with as many as will fit on each line,
     separated by `, ' (a comma and a space).

`-p'
`--file-type'
`--indicator-style=file-type'
     Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
     This is like `-F', except that executables are not marked.

`-x FORMAT'
`--format=across'
`--format=horizontal'
     List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

`-T COLS'
`--tabsize=COLS'
     Assume that each tabstop is COLS columns wide.  The default is 8.
     `ls' uses tabs where possible in the output, for efficiency.  If
     COLS is zero, do not use tabs at all.

`-w'
`--width=COLS'
     Assume the screen is COLS columns wide.  The default is taken from
     the terminal settings if possible; otherwise the environment
     variable `COLUMNS' is used if it is set; otherwise the default is
     80.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Formatting file timestamps,  Next: Formatting the file names,  Prev: General output formatting,  Up: ls invocation

Formatting file timestamps
--------------------------

   By default, file timestamps are listed in abbreviated form.  Most
locales use a timestamp like `2002-03-30 23:45'.  However, the default
POSIX locale uses a date like `Mar 30  2002' for non-recent timestamps,
and a date-without-year and time like `Mar 30 23:45' for recent
timestamps.

   A timestamp is considered to be "recent" if it is less than six
months old, and is not dated in the future.  If a timestamp dated today
is not listed in recent form, the timestamp is in the future, which
means you probably have clock skew problems which may break programs
like `make' that rely on file timestamps.

   The following option changes how file timestamps are printed.

`--time-style=STYLE'
     List timestamps in style STYLE.  The STYLE should be one of the
     following:

    `+FORMAT'
          List timestamps using FORMAT, where FORMAT is interpreted
          like the format argument of `date' (*note date invocation::).
          For example, `--time-style="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"' causes `ls'
          to list timestamps like `2002-03-30 23:45:56'.  As with
          `date', FORMAT's interpretation is affected by the `LC_TIME'
          locale category.

          If FORMAT contains two format strings separated by a newline,
          the former is used for non-recent files and the latter for
          recent files; if you want output columns to line up, you may
          need to insert spaces in one of the two formats.

    `full-iso'
          List timestamps in full using ISO 8601 date, time, and time
          zone format with nanosecond precision, e.g., `2002-03-30
          23:45:56.477817180 -0700'.  This style is equivalent to
          `+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z'.

          This is useful because the time output includes all the
          information that is available from the operating system.  For
          example, this can help explain `make''s behavior, since GNU
          `make' uses the full timestamp to determine whether a file is
          out of date.

    `long-iso'
          List ISO 8601 date and time in minutes, e.g., `2002-03-30
          23:45'.  These timestamps are shorter than `full-iso'
          timestamps, and are usually good enough for everyday work.
          This style is equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'.

    `iso'
          List ISO 8601 dates for non-recent timestamps (e.g.,
          `2002-03-30 '), and ISO 8601 month, day, hour, and minute for
          recent timestamps (e.g., `03-30 23:45').  These timestamps
          are uglier than `long-iso' timestamps, but they carry nearly
          the same information in a smaller space and their brevity
          helps `ls' output fit within traditional 80-column output
          lines.  The following two `ls' invocations are equivalent:

               newline='
               '
               ls -l --time-style="+%Y-%m-%d $newline%m-%d %H:%M"
               ls -l --time-style="iso"

    `locale'
          List timestamps in a locale-dependent form.  For example, a
          Finnish locale might list non-recent timestamps like `maalis
          30  2002' and recent timestamps like `maalis 30 23:45'.
          Locale-dependent timestamps typically consume more space than
          `iso' timestamps and are harder for programs to parse because
          locale conventions vary so widely, but they are easier for
          many people to read.

          The `LC_TIME' locale category specifies the timestamp format.
          The default POSIX locale uses timestamps like `Mar 30  2002'
          and `Mar 30 23:45'; in this locale, the following two `ls'
          invocations are equivalent:

               newline='
               '
               ls -l --time-style="+%b %e  %Y$newline%b %e %H:%M"
               ls -l --time-style="locale"

          Other locales behave differently.  For example, in a German
          locale, `--time-style="locale"' might be equivalent to
          `--time-style="+%e. %b %Y $newline%e. %b %H:%M"' and might
          generate timestamps like `30. Ma"r 2002 ' and `30. Ma"r
          23:45'.

    `posix-STYLE'
          List POSIX-locale timestamps if the `LC_TIME' locale category
          is POSIX, STYLE timestamps otherwise.  For example, the
          default style, which is `posix-long-iso', lists timestamps
          like `Mar 30  2002' and `Mar 30 23:45' when in the POSIX
          locale, and like `2002-03-30 23:45' otherwise.

   You can specify the default value of the `--time-style' option with
the environment variable `TIME_STYLE'; if `TIME_STYLE' is not set the
default style is `posix-long-iso'.  GNU Emacs 21 and later can parse
ISO dates, but older Emacs versions do not, so if you are using an
older version of Emacs and specify a non-POSIX locale, you may need to
set `TIME_STYLE="locale"'.

Formatting the file names
-------------------------

   These options change how file names themselves are printed.

`-b'
`--escape'
`--quoting-style=escape'
     Quote nongraphic characters in file names using alphabetic and
     octal backslash sequences like those used in C.

`-N'
`--literal'
`--quoting-style=literal'
     Do not quote file names.

`-q'
`--hide-control-chars'
     Print question marks instead of nongraphic characters in file
     names.  This is the default if the output is a terminal and the
     program is `ls'.

`-Q'
`--quote-name'
`--quoting-style=c'
     Enclose file names in double quotes and quote nongraphic
     characters as in C.

`--quoting-style=WORD'
     Use style WORD to quote output names.  The WORD should be one of
     the following:
    `literal'
          Output names as-is; this is the same as the `-N' or
          `--literal' option.

    `shell'
          Quote names for the shell if they contain shell
          metacharacters or would cause ambiguous output.

    `shell-always'
          Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally not
          require quoting.

    `c'
          Quote names as for a C language string; this is the same as
          the `-Q' or `--quote-name' option.

    `escape'
          Quote as with `c' except omit the surrounding double-quote
          characters; this is the same as the `-b' or `--escape' option.

    `clocale'
          Quote as with `c' except use quotation marks appropriate for
          the locale.

    `locale'
          Like `clocale', but quote `like this' instead of "like this"
          in the default C locale.  This looks nicer on many displays.

     You can specify the default value of the `--quoting-style' option
     with the environment variable `QUOTING_STYLE'.  If that environment
     variable is not set, the default value is `literal', but this
     default may change to `shell' in a future version of this package.

`--show-control-chars'
     Print nongraphic characters as-is in file names.  This is the
     default unless the output is a terminal and the program is `ls'.

`dir': Briefly list directory contents
======================================

   `dir' (also installed as `d') is equivalent to `ls -C -b'; that is,
by default files are listed in columns, sorted vertically, and special
characters are represented by backslash escape sequences.

   *Note `ls': ls invocation.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: vdir invocation,  Next: dircolors invocation,  Prev: dir invocation,  Up: Directory listing

`vdir': Verbosely list directory contents
=========================================

   `vdir' (also installed as `v') is equivalent to `ls -l -b'; that is,
by default files are listed in long format and special characters are
represented by backslash escape sequences.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: dircolors invocation,  Prev: vdir invocation,  Up: Directory listing

`dircolors': Color setup for `ls'
=================================

   `dircolors' outputs a sequence of shell commands to set up the
terminal for color output from `ls' (and `dir', etc.).  Typical usage:

     eval `dircolors [OPTION]... [FILE]`

   If FILE is specified, `dircolors' reads it to determine which colors
to use for which file types and extensions.  Otherwise, a precompiled
database is used.  For details on the format of these files, run
`dircolors --print-database'.

   The output is a shell command to set the `LS_COLORS' environment
variable.  You can specify the shell syntax to use on the command line,
or `dircolors' will guess it from the value of the `SHELL' environment
variable.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--sh'
`--bourne-shell'
     Output Bourne shell commands.  This is the default if the `SHELL'
     environment variable is set and does not end with `csh' or `tcsh'.

`-c'
`--csh'
`--c-shell'
     Output C shell commands.  This is the default if `SHELL' ends with
     `csh' or `tcsh'.

`-p'
`--print-database'
     Print the (compiled-in) default color configuration database.  This
     output is itself a valid configuration file, and is fairly
     descriptive of the possibilities.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: cp invocation,  Next: dd invocation,  Up: Basic operations

`cp': Copy files and directories
================================

   `cp' copies files (or, optionally, directories).  The copy is
completely independent of the original.  You can either copy one file to
another, or copy arbitrarily many files to a destination directory.
Synopsis:

     cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY

   If the last argument names an existing directory, `cp' copies each
SOURCE file into that directory (retaining the same name).  Otherwise,
if only two files are given, it copies the first onto the second.  It
is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two
non-option arguments are given.

   Generally, files are written just as they are read.  For exceptions,
see the `--sparse' option below.

   By default, `cp' does not copy directories.  However, the `-R',
`-a', and `-r' options cause `cp' to copy recursively by descending
into source directories and copying files to corresponding destination
directories.

   By default, `cp' follows symbolic links only when not copying
recursively.  This default can be overridden with the `--archive'
(`-a'), `-d', `--dereference' (`-L'), `--no-dereference' (`-P'), and
`-H' options.  If more than one of these options is specified, the last
one silently overrides the others.

   By default, `cp' copies the contents of special files only when not
copying recursively.  This default can be overridden with the
`--copy-contents' option.

   `cp' generally refuses to copy a file onto itself, with the
following exception: if `--force --backup' is specified with SOURCE and
DEST identical, and referring to a regular file, `cp' will make a
backup file, either regular or numbered, as specified in the usual ways
(*note Backup options::).  This is useful when you simply want to make
a backup of an existing file before changing it.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--archive'
     Preserve as much as possible of the structure and attributes of the
     original files in the copy (but do not attempt to preserve internal
     directory structure; i.e., `ls -U' may list the entries in a copied
     directory in a different order).  Equivalent to `-dpPR'.

`-b'
`--backup[=METHOD]'
     *Note Backup options::.  Make a backup of each file that would
     otherwise be overwritten or removed.  As a special case, `cp'
     makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are
     given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing,
     regular file.  One useful application of this combination of
     options is this tiny Bourne shell script:

          #!/bin/sh
          # Usage: backup FILE...
          # Create a GNU-style backup of each listed FILE.
          for i; do
            cp --backup --force "$i" "$i"
          done

`--copy-contents'
     If copying recursively, copy the contents of any special files
     (e.g., FIFOs and device files) as if they were regular files.
     This means trying to read the data in each source file and writing
     it to the destination.  It is usually a mistake to use this
     option, as it normally has undesirable effects on special files
     like FIFOs and the ones typically found in the `/dev' directory.
     In most cases, `cp -R --copy-contents' will hang indefinitely
     trying to read from FIFOs and special files like `/dev/console',
     and it will fill up your destination disk if you use it to copy
     `/dev/zero'.  This option has no effect unless copying
     recursively, and it does not affect the copying of symbolic links.

`-d'
     Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the
     files that they point to, and preserve hard links between source
     files in the copies.  Equivalent to `--no-dereference
     --preserve=links'.

`-f'
`--force'
     When copying without this option and an existing destination file
     cannot be opened for writing, the copy fails.  However, with
     `--force'), when a destination file cannot be opened, `cp' then
     unlinks it and tries to open it again.  Contrast this behavior
     with that enabled by `--link' and `--symbolic-link', whereby the
     destination file is never opened but rather is unlinked
     unconditionally.  Also see the description of
     `--remove-destination'.

`-H'
     If a command line argument specifies a symbolic link, then copy the
     file it points to rather than the symbolic link itself.  However,
     copy (preserving its nature) any symbolic link that is encountered
     via recursive traversal.

`-i'
`--interactive'
     Prompt whether to overwrite existing regular destination files.

`-l'
`--link'
     Make hard links instead of copies of non-directories.

`-L'
`--dereference'
     Always follow symbolic links.

`-P'
`--no-dereference'
     Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the
     files that they point to.

`-p'
`--preserve[=ATTRIBUTE_LIST]'
     Preserve the specified attributes of the original files.  If
     specified, the ATTRIBUTE_LIST must be a comma-separated list of
     one or more of the following strings:

    `mode'
          Preserve the permission attributes.

    `ownership'
          Preserve the owner and group.  On most modern systems, only
          the super-user may change the owner of a file, and regular
          users may preserve the group ownership of a file only if they
          happen to be a member of the desired group.

    `timestamps'
          Preserve the times of last access and last modification.

    `links'
          Preserve in the destination files any links between
          corresponding source files.

    `all'
          Preserve all file attributes.  Equivalent to specifying all
          of the above.

     Using `--preserve' with no ATTRIBUTE_LIST is equivalent to
     `--preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps'.

     In the absence of this option, each destination file is created
     with the permissions of the corresponding source file, minus the
     bits set in the umask and minus the set-user-id and set-group-id
     bits. *Note File permissions::.

`--no-preserve=ATTRIBUTE_LIST'
     Do not preserve the specified attributes.  The ATTRIBUTE_LIST has
     the same form as for `--preserve'.

`--parents'
     Form the name of each destination file by appending to the target
     directory a slash and the specified name of the source file.  The
     last argument given to `cp' must be the name of an existing
     directory.  For example, the command:

          cp --parents a/b/c existing_dir

     copies the file `a/b/c' to `existing_dir/a/b/c', creating any
     missing intermediate directories.

`--reply[=HOW]'
     Using `--reply=yes' makes `cp' act as if `yes' were given as a
     response to every prompt about a destination file.  That
     effectively cancels any preceding `--interactive' or `-i' option.
     Specify `--reply=no' to make `cp' act as if `no' were given as a
     response to every prompt about a destination file.  Specify
     `--reply=query' to make `cp' prompt the user about each existing
     destination file.

`-R'
`-r'
`--recursive'
     Copy directories recursively.  Symbolic links are not followed by
     default; see the `--archive' (`-a'), `-d', `--dereference' (`-L'),
     `--no-dereference' (`-P'), and `-H' options.  Special files are
     copied by creating a destination file of the same type as the
     source; see the `--copy-contents' option.  It is not portable to
     use `-r' to copy symbolic links or special files.  On some non-GNU
     systems, `-r' implies the equivalent of `-L' and `--copy-contents'
     for historical reasons.  Also, it is not portable to use `-R' to
     copy symbolic links unless you also specify `-P', as POSIX allows
     implementations that dereference symbolic links by default.

`--remove-destination'
     Remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it
     (contrast with `-f' above).

`--sparse=WHEN'
     A "sparse file" contains "holes"--a sequence of zero bytes that
     does not occupy any physical disk blocks; the `read' system call
     reads these as zeroes.  This can both save considerable disk space
     and increase speed, since many binary files contain lots of
     consecutive zero bytes.  By default, `cp' detects holes in input
     source files via a crude heuristic and makes the corresponding
     output file sparse as well.

     The WHEN value can be one of the following:
    `auto'
          The default behavior: the output file is sparse if the input
          file is sparse.

    `always'
          Always make the output file sparse.  This is useful when the
          input file resides on a filesystem that does not support
          sparse files (the most notable example is `efs' filesystems
          in SGI IRIX 5.3 and earlier), but the output file is on
          another type of filesystem.

    `never'
          Never make the output file sparse.  This is useful in
          creating a file for use with the `mkswap' command, since such
          a file must not have any holes.

`--strip-trailing-slashes'
     Remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument.  *Note
     Trailing slashes::.

`-s'
`--symbolic-link'
     Make symbolic links instead of copies of non-directories.  All
     source file names must be absolute (starting with `/') unless the
     destination files are in the current directory.  This option merely
     results in an error message on systems that do not support
     symbolic links.

`-S SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with `-b'.  *Note Backup
     options::.

`--target-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specify the destination DIRECTORY.  *Note Target directory::.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Print the name of each file before copying it.

`-V METHOD'
`--version-control=METHOD'
     Change the type of backups made with `-b'.  The METHOD argument
     can be `none' (or `off'), `numbered' (or `t'), `existing' (or
     `nil'), or `never' (or `simple').  *Note Backup options::.

`-x'
`--one-file-system'
     Skip subdirectories that are on different filesystems from the one
     that the copy started on.  However, mount point directories _are_
     copied.

`dd': Convert and copy a file
=============================

   `dd' copies a file (from standard input to standard output, by
default) with a changeable I/O block size, while optionally performing
conversions on it.  Synopsis:

     dd [OPTION]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

   The numeric-valued options below (BYTES and BLOCKS) can be followed
by a multiplier: `b'=512, `c'=1, `w'=2, `xM'=M, or any of the standard
block size suffixes like `k'=1024 (*note Block size::).

   Use different `dd' invocations to use different block sizes for
skipping and I/O.  For example, the following shell commands copy data
in 512 KiB blocks between a disk and a tape, but do not save or restore
a 4 KiB label at the start of the disk:

     disk=/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2
     tape=/dev/rmt/0
     
     # Copy all but the label from disk to tape.
     (dd bs=4k skip=1 count=0 && dd bs=512k) <$disk >$tape
     
     # Copy from tape back to disk, but leave the disk label alone.
     (dd bs=4k seek=1 count=0 && dd bs=512k) <$tape >$disk

`if=FILE'
     Read from FILE instead of standard input.

`of=FILE'
     Write to FILE instead of standard output.  Unless `conv=notrunc'
     is given, `dd' truncates FILE to zero bytes (or the size specified
     with `seek=').

`ibs=BYTES'
     Read BYTES bytes at a time.

`obs=BYTES'
     Write BYTES bytes at a time.

`bs=BYTES'
     Both read and write BYTES bytes at a time.  This overrides `ibs'
     and `obs'.

`cbs=BYTES'
     Convert BYTES bytes at a time.

`skip=BLOCKS'
     Skip BLOCKS `ibs'-byte blocks in the input file before copying.

`seek=BLOCKS'
     Skip BLOCKS `obs'-byte blocks in the output file before copying.

`count=BLOCKS'
     Copy BLOCKS `ibs'-byte blocks from the input file, instead of
     everything until the end of the file.

`conv=CONVERSION[,CONVERSION]...'
     Convert the file as specified by the CONVERSION argument(s).  (No
     spaces around any comma(s).)

     Conversions:

    `ascii'
          Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

    `ebcdic'
          Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.

    `ibm'
          Convert ASCII to alternate EBCDIC.

    `block'
          For each line in the input, output `cbs' bytes, replacing the
          input newline with a space and padding with spaces as
          necessary.

    `unblock'
          Replace trailing spaces in each `cbs'-sized input block with a
          newline.

    `lcase'
          Change uppercase letters to lowercase.

    `ucase'
          Change lowercase letters to uppercase.

    `swab'
          Swap every pair of input bytes.  GNU `dd', unlike others,
          works when an odd number of bytes are read--the last byte is
          simply copied (since there is nothing to swap it with).

    `noerror'
          Continue after read errors.

    `notrunc'
          Do not truncate the output file.

    `sync'
          Pad every input block to size of `ibs' with trailing zero
          bytes.  When used with `block' or `unblock', pad with spaces
          instead of zero bytes.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: install invocation,  Next: mv invocation,  Prev: dd invocation,  Up: Basic operations

`install': Copy files and set attributes
========================================

   `install' copies files while setting their permission modes and, if
possible, their owner and group.  Synopses:

     install [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     install [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
     install -d [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...

   In the first of these, the SOURCE file is copied to the DEST target
file.  In the second, each of the SOURCE files are copied to the
destination DIRECTORY.  In the last, each DIRECTORY (and any missing
parent directories) is created.

   `install' is similar to `cp', but allows you to control the
attributes of destination files.  It is typically used in Makefiles to
copy programs into their destination directories.  It refuses to copy
files onto themselves.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--backup[=METHOD]'
     *Note Backup options::.  Make a backup of each file that would
     otherwise be overwritten or removed.

`-c'
     Ignored; for compatibility with old Unix versions of `install'.

`-d'
`--directory'
     Create each given directory and any missing parent directories,
     setting the owner, group and mode as given on the command line or
     to the defaults.  It also gives any parent directories it creates
     those attributes.  (This is different from the SunOS 4.x
     `install', which gives directories that it creates the default
     attributes.)

`-g GROUP'
`--group=GROUP'
     Set the group ownership of installed files or directories to
     GROUP. The default is the process' current group.  GROUP may be
     either a group name or a numeric group id.

`-m MODE'
`--mode=MODE'
     Set the permissions for the installed file or directory to MODE,
     which can be either an octal number, or a symbolic mode as in
     `chmod', with 0 as the point of departure (*note File
     permissions::).  The default mode is `u=rwx,go=rx'--read, write,
     and execute for the owner, and read and execute for group and
     other.

`-o OWNER'
`--owner=OWNER'
     If `install' has appropriate privileges (is run as root), set the
     ownership of installed files or directories to OWNER. The default
     is `root'.  OWNER may be either a user name or a numeric user ID.

`-p'
`--preserve-timestamps'
     Set the time of last access and the time of last modification of
     each installed file to match those of each corresponding original
     file.  When a file is installed without this option, its last
     access and last modification times are both set to the time of
     installation.  This option is useful if you want to use the last
     modification times of installed files to keep track of when they
     were last built as opposed to when they were last installed.

`-s'
`--strip'
     Strip the symbol tables from installed binary executables.

`-S SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with `-b'.  *Note Backup
     options::.

`--target-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specify the destination DIRECTORY.  *Note Target directory::.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Print the name of each file before copying it.

`-V METHOD'
`--version-control=METHOD'
     Change the type of backups made with `-b'.  The METHOD argument
     can be `none' (or `off'), `numbered' (or `t'), `existing' (or
     `nil'), or `never' (or `simple').  *Note Backup options::.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: mv invocation,  Next: rm invocation,  Prev: install invocation,  Up: Basic operations

`mv': Move (rename) files
=========================

   `mv' moves or renames files (or directories).  Synopsis:

     mv [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
     mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY

   If the last argument names an existing directory, `mv' moves each
other given file into a file with the same name in that directory.
Otherwise, if only two files are given, it renames the first as the
second.  It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and
more than two files are given.

   `mv' can move any type of file from one filesystem to another.
Prior to version `4.0' of the fileutils, `mv' could move only regular
files between filesystems.  For example, now `mv' can move an entire
directory hierarchy including special device files from one partition
to another.  It first uses some of the same code that's used by `cp -a'
to copy the requested directories and files, then (assuming the copy
succeeded) it removes the originals.  If the copy fails, then the part
that was copied to the destination partition is removed.  If you were
to copy three directories from one partition to another and the copy of
the first directory succeeded, but the second didn't, the first would
be left on the destination partition and the second and third would be
left on the original partition.

   If a destination file exists but is normally unwritable, standard
input is a terminal, and the `-f' or `--force' option is not given,
`mv' prompts the user for whether to replace the file.  (You might own
the file, or have write permission on its directory.)  If the response
does not begin with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

   _Warning_: If you try to move a symlink that points to a directory,
and you specify the symlink with a trailing slash, then `mv' doesn't
move the symlink but instead moves the directory referenced by the
symlink.  *Note Trailing slashes::.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--backup[=METHOD]'
     *Note Backup options::.  Make a backup of each file that would
     otherwise be overwritten or removed.

`-f'
`--force'
     Do not prompt the user before removing a destination file.

`-i'
`--interactive'
     Prompt whether to overwrite each existing destination file,
     regardless of its permissions.  If the response does not begin
     with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

`--reply[=HOW]'
     Specifying `--reply=yes' is equivalent to using `--force'.
     Specify `--reply=no' to make `mv' act as if `no' were given as a
     response to every prompt about a destination file.  Specify
     `--reply=query' to make `mv' prompt the user about each existing
     destination file.

`-u'
`--update'
     Do not move a non-directory that has an existing destination with
     the same or newer modification time.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Print the name of each file before moving it.

`--strip-trailing-slashes'
     Remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument.  *Note
     Trailing slashes::.

`-S SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with `-b'.  *Note Backup
     options::.

`--target-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specify the destination DIRECTORY.  *Note Target directory::.

`-V METHOD'
`--version-control=METHOD'
     Change the type of backups made with `-b'.  The METHOD argument
     can be `none' (or `off'), `numbered' (or `t'), `existing' (or
     `nil'), or `never' (or `simple').  *Note Backup options::.

`rm': Remove files or directories
=================================

   `rm' removes each given FILE.  By default, it does not remove
directories.  Synopsis:

     rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the `-f'
or `--force' option is not given, or the `-i' or `--interactive' option
_is_ given, `rm' prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If
the response does not begin with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

   _Warning_: If you use `rm' to remove a file, it is usually possible
to recover the contents of that file.  If you want more assurance that
the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using `shred'.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-d'
`--directory'
     Attempt to remove directories using the `unlink' function rather
     than the `rmdir' function, and don't require a directory to be
     empty before trying to unlink it.  This works only if you have
     appropriate privileges and if your operating system supports
     `unlink' for directories.  Because unlinking a directory causes
     any files in the deleted directory to become unreferenced, it is
     wise to `fsck' the filesystem after doing this.

`-f'
`--force'
     Ignore nonexistent files and never prompt the user.  Ignore any
     previous `--interactive' (`-i') option.

`-i'
`--interactive'
     Prompt whether to remove each file.  If the response does not begin
     with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.  Ignore any previous
     `--force' (`-f') option.

`-r'
`-R'
`--recursive'
     Remove the contents of directories recursively.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Print the name of each file before removing it.


   One common question is how to remove files whose names begin with a
`-'.  GNU `rm', like every program that uses the `getopt' function to
parse its arguments, lets you use the `--' option to indicate that all
following arguments are non-options.  To remove a file called `-f' in
the current directory, you could type either:

     rm -- -f

or:

     rm ./-f

   The Unix `rm' program's use of a single `-' for this purpose
predates the development of the getopt standard syntax.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: shred invocation,  Prev: rm invocation,  Up: Basic operations

`shred': Remove files more securely
===================================

   `shred' overwrites devices or files, to help prevent even very
expensive hardware from recovering the data.

   Ordinarily when you remove a file (*note rm invocation::), the data
is not actually destroyed.  Only the index listing where the file is
stored is destroyed, and the storage is made available for reuse.
There are undelete utilities that will attempt to reconstruct the index
and can bring the file back if the parts were not reused.

   On a busy system with a nearly-full drive, space can get reused in a
few seconds.  But there is no way to know for sure.  If you have
sensitive data, you may want to be sure that recovery is not possible
by actually overwriting the file with non-sensitive data.

   However, even after doing that, it is possible to take the disk back
to a laboratory and use a lot of sensitive (and expensive) equipment to
look for the faint "echoes" of the original data underneath the
overwritten data.  If the data has only been overwritten once, it's not
even that hard.

   The best way to remove something irretrievably is to destroy the
media it's on with acid, melt it down, or the like.  For cheap
removable media like floppy disks, this is the preferred method.
However, hard drives are expensive and hard to melt, so the `shred'
utility tries to achieve a similar effect non-destructively.

   This uses many overwrite passes, with the data patterns chosen to
maximize the damage they do to the old data.  While this will work on
floppies, the patterns are designed for best effect on hard drives.
For more details, see the source code and Peter Gutmann's paper `Secure
Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory', from the
proceedings of the Sixth USENIX Security Symposium (San Jose,
California, 22-25 July, 1996).  The paper is also available online
<http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html>.

   *Please note* that `shred' relies on a very important assumption:
that the filesystem overwrites data in place.  This is the traditional
way to do things, but many modern filesystem designs do not satisfy this
assumption.  Exceptions include:

   * Log-structured or journaled filesystems, such as those supplied
     with AIX and Solaris, and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.

   * Filesystems that write redundant data and carry on even if some
     writes fail, such as RAID-based filesystems.

   * Filesystems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS
     server.

   * Filesystems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version
     3 clients.

   * Compressed filesystems.

   If you are not sure how your filesystem operates, then you should
assume that it does not overwrite data in place, which means that shred
cannot reliably operate on regular files in your filesystem.

   Generally speaking, it is more reliable to shred a device than a
file, since this bypasses the problem of filesystem design mentioned
above.  However, even shredding devices is not always completely
reliable.  For example, most disks map out bad sectors invisibly to the
application; if the bad sectors contain sensitive data, `shred' won't
be able to destroy it.

   `shred' makes no attempt to detect or report this problem, just as
it makes no attempt to do anything about backups.  However, since it is
more reliable to shred devices than files, `shred' by default does not
truncate or remove the output file.  This default is more suitable for
devices, which typically cannot be truncated and should not be removed.

   Finally, consider the risk of backups and mirrors.  File system
backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot
be removed, and that will allow a shredded file to be recovered later.
So if you keep any data you may later want to destroy using `shred', be
sure that it is not backed up or mirrored.

     shred [OPTION]... FILE[...]

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f'
`--force'
     Override file permissions if necessary to allow overwriting.

`-NUMBER'
`-n NUMBER'
`--iterations=NUMBER'
     By default, `shred' uses 25 passes of overwrite.  This is enough
     for all of the useful overwrite patterns to be used at least once.
     You can reduce this to save time, or increase it if you have a lot
     of time to waste.

`-s BYTES'
`--size=BYTES'
     Shred the first BYTES bytes of the file. The default is to shred
     the whole file.  BYTES can be followed by a size specification like
     `K', `M', or `G' to specify a multiple. *Note Block size::.

`-u'
`--remove'
     After shredding a file, truncate it (if possible) and then remove
     it.  If a file has multiple links, only the named links will be
     removed.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Display status updates as sterilization proceeds.

`-x'
`--exact'
     By default, `shred' rounds the size of a regular file up to the
     next multiple of the filesystem block size to fully erase the last
     block of the file.  Use `--exact' to suppress that behavior.
     Thus, by default if you shred a 10-byte regular file on a system
     with 512-byte blocks, the resulting file will be 512 bytes long.
     With this option, shred does not increase the apparent size of the
     file.

`-z'
`--zero'
     Normally, the last pass that `shred' writes is made up of random
     data.  If this would be conspicuous on your hard drive (for
     example, because it looks like encrypted data), or you just think
     it's tidier, the `--zero' option adds an additional overwrite pass
     with all zero bits.  This is in addition to the number of passes
     specified by the `--iterations' option.

`-'
     Shred standard output.

     This argument is considered an option.  If the common `--' option
     has been used to indicate the end of options on the command line,
     then `-' will be interpreted as an ordinary file name.

     The intended use of this is to shred a removed temporary file.
     For example

          i=`tempfile -m 0600`
          exec 3<>"$i"
          rm -- "$i"
          echo "Hello, world" >&3
          shred - >&3
          exec 3>-

     Note that the shell command `shred - >file' does not shred the
     contents of FILE, since it truncates FILE before invoking `shred'.
     Use the command `shred file' or (if using a Bourne-compatible
     shell) the command `shred - 1<>file' instead.


   You might use the following command to erase all trace of the
filesystem you'd created on the floppy disk in your first drive.  That
command takes about 20 minutes to erase a "1.44MB" (actually 1440 KiB)
floppy.

     shred --verbose /dev/fd0

   Similarly, to erase all data on a selected partition of your hard
disk, you could give a command like this:

     shred --verbose /dev/sda5

Special file types
******************

   This chapter describes commands which create special types of files
(and `rmdir', which removes directories, one special file type).

   Although Unix-like operating systems have markedly fewer special file
types than others, not _everything_ can be treated only as the
undifferentiated byte stream of "normal files".  For example, when a
file is created or removed, the system must record this information,
which it does in a "directory"--a special type of file.  Although you
can read directories as normal files, if you're curious, in order for
the system to do its job it must impose a structure, a certain order,
on the bytes of the file.  Thus it is a "special" type of file.

   Besides directories, other special file types include named pipes
(FIFOs), symbolic links, sockets, and so-called "special files".

`link': Make a hard link via the link syscall
=============================================

   `link' creates a single hard link at a time.  It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided `link' function.  *Note Hard Links:
(libc)Hard Links.  Synopsis:

     link FILENAME LINKNAME

   FILENAME must specify an existing file, and LINKNAME must specify a
nonexistent entry in an existing directory.  `link' simply calls `link
(FILENAME, LINKNAME)' to create the link.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: ln invocation,  Next: mkdir invocation,  Prev: link invocation,  Up: Special file types

`ln': Make links between files
==============================

   `ln' makes links between files.  By default, it makes hard links;
with the `-s' option, it makes symbolic (or "soft") links.  Synopses:

     ln [OPTION]... TARGET [LINKNAME]
     ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY

   * If the last argument names an existing directory, `ln' creates a
     link to each TARGET file in that directory, using the TARGETs'
     names.  (But see the description of the `--no-dereference' option
     below.)

   * If two filenames are given, `ln' creates a link from the second to
     the first.

   * If one TARGET is given, `ln' creates a link to that file in the
     current directory.

   * It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more
     than two files are given.  Without `-f' or `-i' (see below), `ln'
     will not remove an existing file.  Use the `--backup' option to
     make `ln' rename existing files.


   A "hard link" is another name for an existing file; the link and the
original are indistinguishable.  Technically speaking, they share the
same inode, and the inode contains all the information about a
file--indeed, it is not incorrect to say that the inode _is_ the file.
On all existing implementations, you cannot make a hard link to a
directory, and hard links cannot cross filesystem boundaries.  (These
restrictions are not mandated by POSIX, however.)

   "Symbolic links" ("symlinks" for short), on the other hand, are a
special file type (which not all kernels support: System V release 3
(and older) systems lack symlinks) in which the link file actually
refers to a different file, by name.  When most operations (opening,
reading, writing, and so on) are passed the symbolic link file, the
kernel automatically "dereferences" the link and operates on the target
of the link.  But some operations (e.g., removing) work on the link
file itself, rather than on its target.  *Note Symbolic Links:
(libc)Symbolic Links.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`--backup[=METHOD]'
     *Note Backup options::.  Make a backup of each file that would
     otherwise be overwritten or removed.

`-d'
`-F'
`--directory'
     Allow the super-user to make hard links to directories.

`-f'
`--force'
     Remove existing destination files.

`-i'
`--interactive'
     Prompt whether to remove existing destination files.

`-n'
`--no-dereference'
     When given an explicit destination that is a symlink to a
     directory, treat that destination as if it were a normal file.

     When the destination is an actual directory (not a symlink to one),
     there is no ambiguity.  The link is created in that directory.
     But when the specified destination is a symlink to a directory,
     there are two ways to treat the user's request.  `ln' can treat
     the destination just as it would a normal directory and create the
     link in it.  On the other hand, the destination can be viewed as a
     non-directory--as the symlink itself.  In that case, `ln' must
     delete or backup that symlink before creating the new link.  The
     default is to treat a destination that is a symlink to a directory
     just like a directory.

`-s'
`--symbolic'
     Make symbolic links instead of hard links.  This option merely
     produces an error message on systems that do not support symbolic
     links.

`-S SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with `-b'.  *Note Backup

`--target-directory=DIRECTORY'
     Specify the destination DIRECTORY.  *Note Target directory::.

`-v'
`--verbose'

     Change the type of backups made with `-b'.  The METHOD argument
     can be `none' (or `off'), `numbered' (or `t'), `existing' (or
     `nil'), or `never' (or `simple').  *Note Backup options::.

`mkdir': Make directories
=========================

   `mkdir' creates directories with the specified names.  Synopsis:

     mkdir [OPTION]... NAME...

   If a NAME is an existing file but not a directory, `mkdir' prints a
warning message on stderr and will exit with a status of 1 after
processing any remaining NAMEs.  The same is done when a NAME is an
existing directory and the -p option is not given.  If a NAME is an
existing directory and the -p option is given, `mkdir' will ignore it.
That is, `mkdir' will not print a warning, raise an error, or change
the mode of the directory (even if the -m option is given), and will
move on to processing any remaining NAMEs.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-m MODE'
`--mode=MODE'
     Set the mode of created directories to MODE, which is symbolic as
     in `chmod' and uses `a=rwx' (read, write and execute allowed for
     everyone) minus the bits set in the umask for the point of the
     departure.  *Note File permissions::.

`-p'
`--parents'
     Make any missing parent directories for each argument.  The mode
     for parent directories is set to the umask modified by `u+wx'.
     Ignore arguments corresponding to existing directories.

`-v'

`--verbose'
     Print a message for each created directory.  This is most useful
     with `--parents'.

`mkfifo': Make FIFOs (named pipes)
==================================

   `mkfifo' creates FIFOs (also called "named pipes") with the
specified names.  Synopsis:

     mkfifo [OPTION] NAME...

   A "FIFO" is a special file type that permits independent processes
to communicate.  One process opens the FIFO file for writing, and
another for reading, after which data can flow as with the usual
anonymous pipe in shells or elsewhere.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-m MODE'
`--mode=MODE'
     Set the mode of created FIFOs to MODE, which is symbolic as in
     `chmod' and uses `a=rw' (read and write allowed for everyone) minus
     the bits set in the umask for the point of departure.  *Note File
     permissions::.

`mknod': Make block or character special files
==============================================

   `mknod' creates a FIFO, character special file, or block special
file with the specified name.  Synopsis:

     mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

   Unlike the phrase "special file type" above, the term "special file"
has a technical meaning on Unix: something that can generate or receive
data.  Usually this corresponds to a physical piece of hardware, e.g.,
a printer or a disk.  (These files are typically created at
system-configuration time.)  The `mknod' command is what creates files
of this type.  Such devices can be read either a character at a time or
a "block" (many characters) at a time, hence we say there are "block
special" files and "character special" files.

   The arguments after NAME specify the type of file to make:

`p'
     for a FIFO

`b'
     for a block special file

`c'
     for a character special file


   When making a block or character special file, the major and minor
device numbers must be given after the file type.  If a major or minor
device number begins with `0x' or `0X', it is interpreted as
hexadecimal; otherwise, if it begins with `0', as octal; otherwise, as
decimal.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-m MODE'
`--mode=MODE'
     Set the mode of created files to MODE, which is symbolic as in
     `chmod' and uses `a=rw' minus the bits set in the umask as the
     point of departure.  *Note File permissions::.

`readlink': Print the referent of a symbolic link
=================================================

   `readlink' may work in one of two supported modes:

`Readlink mode'
     `readlink' outputs the value of the given symbolic link.  If
     `readlink' is invoked with an argument other than the pathname of
     a symbolic link, it exits with a non-zero exit code.

`Canonicalize mode'
     `readlink' outputs the absolute name of the given file which
     contains no `.', `..' components nor any repeated path separators
     (`/') or symlinks.  In any of the path components is missing or
     unavailable, it exits with a non-zero exit code.


     readlink [OPTION] FILE

   By default, `readlink' operates in readlink mode.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f'
`--canonicalize'
     Activate canonicalize mode.

`-n'
`--no-newline'
     Do not output the trailing newline.

`-s'
`-q'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Suppress most error messages.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Report error messages.

`rmdir': Remove empty directories
=================================

   `rmdir' removes empty directories.  Synopsis:

     rmdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...

   If any DIRECTORY argument does not refer to an existing empty
directory, it is an error.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`--ignore-fail-on-non-empty'
     Ignore each failure to remove a directory that is solely because
     the directory is non-empty.

`-p'
`--parents'
     Remove DIRECTORY, then try to remove each component of DIRECTORY.
     So, for example, `rmdir -p a/b/c' is similar to `rmdir a/b/c a/b
     a'.  As such, it fails if any of those directories turns out not
     to be empty.  Use the `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty' option to make
     it so such a failure does not evoke a diagnostic and does not
     cause `rmdir' to exit unsuccessfully.

`-v'

`--verbose'
     Give a diagnostic for each successful removal.  DIRECTORY is
     removed.

(recursively).

`unlink': Remove files via the unlink syscall
=============================================

   `unlink' deletes a single specified file name.  It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided `unlink' function.  *Note Deleting
Files: (libc)Deleting Files.  Synopsis:

     unlink FILENAME

   On some systems `unlink' can be used to delete the name of a
directory.  On others, it can be used that way only by a privileged
user.  In the GNU system `unlink' can never delete the name of a
directory.

   By default, `unlink' honors the `--help' and `--version' options.
That makes it a little harder to remove files named `--help' and
`--version', so when the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set,
`unlink' treats such a command line arguments not as an option, but as
an operand.

Changing file attributes
************************

   A file is not merely its contents, a name, and a file type (*note
Special file types::).  A file also has an owner (a userid), a group (a
group id), permissions (what the owner can do with the file, what
people in the group can do, and what everyone else can do), various
timestamps, and other information.  Collectively, we call these a file's
"attributes".

   These commands change file attributes.

* chgrp invocation::            Change file groups.
* chmod invocation::            Change access permissions.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: chown invocation,  Next: touch invocation,  Prev: chmod invocation,  Up: Changing file attributes

`chown': Change file owner and group
====================================

   `chown' changes the user and/or group ownership of each given FILE
to NEW-OWNER or to the user and group of an existing reference file.
Synopsis:

     chown [OPTION]... {NEW-OWNER | --reference=REF_FILE} FILE...

   If used, NEW-OWNER specifies the new owner and/or group as follows
(with no embedded white space):

     [OWNER] [ [:] [GROUP] ]

   Specifically:

OWNER
     If only an OWNER (a user name or numeric user id) is given, that
     user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is
     not changed.

OWNER`:'GROUP
     If the OWNER is followed by a colon and a GROUP (a group name or
     numeric group id), with no spaces between them, the group
     ownership of the files is changed as well (to GROUP).

OWNER`:'
     If a colon but no group name follows OWNER, that user is made the
     owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to
     OWNER's login group.

`:'GROUP
     If the colon and following GROUP are given, but the owner is
     omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case,
     `chown' performs the same function as `chgrp'.


   You may use `.' in place of the `:' separator.  This is a GNU
extension for compatibility with older scripts.  New scripts should
avoid the use of `.' because GNU `chown' may fail if OWNER contains `.'
characters.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--changes'
     Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose ownership
     actually changes.

`-f'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be
     changed.

`--from=OLD-OWNER'
     Change a FILE's ownership only if it has current attributes
     specified by OLD-OWNER.  OLD-OWNER has the same form as NEW-OWNER
     described above.  This option is useful primarily from a security
     standpoint in that it narrows considerably the window of potential
     abuse.  For example, to reflect a UID numbering change for one
     user's files without an option like this, `root' might run

          find / -owner OLDUSER -print0 | xargs -0 chown NEWUSER

     But that is dangerous because the interval between when the `find'
     tests the existing file's owner and when the `chown' is actually
     run may be quite large.  One way to narrow the gap would be to
     invoke chown for each file as it is found:

          find / -owner OLDUSER -exec chown NEWUSER {} \;

     But that is very slow if there are many affected files.  With this
     option, it is safer (the gap is narrower still) though still not
     perfect:

          chown -R --from=OLDUSER NEWUSER /

`--dereference'
     Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they
     point to.

`-h'
`--no-dereference'
     Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
     This is the default.  This mode relies on the `lchown' system call.
     On systems that do not provide the `lchown' system call, `chown'
     fails when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.
     By default, no diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered
     during a recursive traversal, but see `--verbose'.

`--reference=REF_FILE'
     Change the user and group of each FILE to be the same as those of
     REF_FILE.  If REF_FILE is a symbolic link, do not use the user and
     group of the symbolic link, but rather those of the file it refers
     to.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Output a diagnostic for every file processed.  If a symbolic link
     is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without
     the `lchown' system call, and `--no-dereference' is in effect,
     then issue a diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its
     referent is being changed.

`-R'
`--recursive'
     Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents.

`chgrp': Change group ownership
===============================

   `chgrp' changes the group ownership of each given FILE to GROUP
(which can be either a group name or a numeric group id) or to the
group of an existing reference file.  Synopsis:

     chgrp [OPTION]... {GROUP | --reference=REF_FILE} FILE...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'

     Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose group actually
     changes.

`-f'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Do not print error messages about files whose group cannot be
     changed.

`--dereference'
     Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they
     point to.

`-h'
`--no-dereference'
     Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
     This is the default.  This mode relies on the `lchown' system call.
     On systems that do not provide the `lchown' system call, `chgrp'
     fails when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.
     By default, no diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered
     during a recursive traversal, but see `--verbose'.

`--reference=REF_FILE'
     Change the group of each FILE to be the same as that of REF_FILE.

     is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without
     the `lchown' system call, and `--no-dereference' is in effect,
     then issue a diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its

`chmod': Change access permissions
==================================

   `chmod' changes the access permissions of the named files.  Synopsis:

     chmod [OPTION]... {MODE | --reference=REF_FILE} FILE...

   `chmod' never changes the permissions of symbolic links, since the
`chmod' system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.
However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, `chmod'
changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, `chmod'
ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory
traversals.

   If used, MODE specifies the new permissions.  For details, see the
section on *Note File permissions::.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--changes'
     Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose permissions
     actually changes.

`-f'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Do not print error messages about files whose permissions cannot be
     changed.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbosely describe the action or non-action taken for every FILE.

`--reference=REF_FILE'
     Change the mode of each FILE to be the same as that of REF_FILE.
     *Note File permissions::.  If REF_FILE is a symbolic link, do not
     use the mode of the symbolic link, but rather that of the file it
     refers to.

`-R'
`--recursive'
     Recursively change permissions of directories and their contents.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: touch invocation,  Prev: chown invocation,  Up: Changing file attributes

`touch': Change file timestamps
===============================

   `touch' changes the access and/or modification times of the
specified files.  Synopsis:

     touch [OPTION]... FILE...

   On older systems, `touch' supports an obsolete syntax, as follows.
If the first FILE would be a valid argument to the `-t' option and no
timestamp is given with any of the `-d', `-r', or `-t' options and the
`--' argument is not given, that argument is interpreted as the time
for the other files instead of as a file name.  POSIX 1003.1-2001
(*note Standards conformance::) does not allow this; use `-t' instead.

   Any FILE that does not exist is created empty.

   If changing both the access and modification times to the current
time, `touch' can change the timestamps for files that the user running
it does not own but has write permission for.  Otherwise, the user must
own the files.

   Although `touch' provides options for changing two of the times -
the times of last access and modification - of a file, there is actually
a third one as well: the inode change time.  This is often referred to
as a file's `ctime'.  The inode change time represents the time when
the file's meta-information last changed.  One common example of this
is when the permissions of a file change.  Changing the permissions
doesn't access the file, so the atime doesn't change, nor does it
modify the file, so the mtime doesn't change.  Yet, something about the
file itself has changed, and this must be noted somewhere.  This is the
job of the ctime field.  This is necessary, so that, for example, a
backup program can make a fresh copy of the file, including the new
permissions value.  Another operation that modifies a file's ctime
without affecting the others is renaming.  In any case, it is not
possible, in normal operations, for a user to change the ctime field to
a user-specified value.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--time=atime'
`--time=access'
`--time=use'
     Change the access time only.

`-c'
`--no-create'
     Do not create files that do not exist.

`-d'
`--date=time'
     Use TIME instead of the current time.  It can contain month names,
     time zones, `am' and `pm', etc.  *Note Date input formats::.

`-f'
     Ignored; for compatibility with BSD versions of `touch'.

`-m'
`--time=mtime'
`--time=modify'
     Change the modification time only.

`-r FILE'
`--reference=FILE'
     Use the times of the reference FILE instead of the current time.

`-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]'
     Use the argument (optional four-digit or two-digit years, months,
     days, hours, minutes, optional seconds) instead of the current
     time.  If the year is specified with only two digits, then CC is
     20 for years in the range 0 ... 68, and 19 for years in 69 ... 99.
     If no digits of the year are specified, the argument is
     interpreted as a date in the current year.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: df invocation,  Next: du invocation,  Up: Disk usage

`df': Report filesystem disk space usage
========================================

   `df' reports the amount of disk space used and available on
filesystems.  Synopsis:

     df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   With no arguments, `df' reports the space used and available on all
currently mounted filesystems (of all types).  Otherwise, `df' reports
on the filesystem containing each argument FILE.

   Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but this
can be overridden (*note Block size::).  Non-integer quantities are
rounded up to the next higher unit.

   If an argument FILE is a disk device file containing a mounted
filesystem, `df' shows the space available on that filesystem rather
than on the filesystem containing the device node (i.e., the root
filesystem).  GNU `df' does not attempt to determine the disk usage on
unmounted filesystems, because on most kinds of systems doing so
requires extremely nonportable intimate knowledge of filesystem
structures.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--all'
     Include in the listing filesystems that have a size of 0 blocks,
     which are omitted by default.  Such filesystems are typically
     special-purpose pseudo-filesystems, such as automounter entries.
     Also, filesystems of type "ignore" or "auto", supported by some
     operating systems, are only included if this option is specified.

`-B SIZE'
`--block-size=SIZE'
     Scale sizes by SIZE before printing them (*note Block size::).
     For example, `-BG' prints sizes in units of 1,073,741,824 bytes.

`-h'
`--human-readable'
     Append a size letter to each size, such as `M' for mebibytes.
     Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; `M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
     Use the `-H' or `--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

`-H'
`--si'
     Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as `MB' for
     megabytes.  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; `MB' stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the `-h' or `--human-readable' option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

`-i'
`--inodes'
     List inode usage information instead of block usage.  An inode
     (short for index node) contains information about a file such as
     its owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the disk.

`-k'
     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
     (*note Block size::).  This option is equivalent to
     `--block-size=1K'.

`-l'
`--local'
     Limit the listing to local filesystems.  By default, remote
     filesystems are also listed.

`--no-sync'
     Do not invoke the `sync' system call before getting any usage data.
     This may make `df' run significantly faster on systems with many
     disks, but on some systems (notably SunOS) the results may be
     slightly out of date.  This is the default.

`-P'
`--portability'
     Use the POSIX output format.  This is like the default format
     except for the following:

       1. The information about each filesystem is always printed on
          exactly one line; a mount device is never put on a line by
          itself.  This means that if the mount device name is more
          than 20 characters long (e.g., for some network mounts), the
          columns are misaligned.

       2. The labels in the header output line are changed to conform
          to POSIX.

`--sync'
     Invoke the `sync' system call before getting any usage data.  On
     some systems (notably SunOS), doing this yields more up to date
     results, but in general this option makes `df' much slower,
     especially when there are many or very busy filesystems.

`-t FSTYPE'
`--type=FSTYPE'
     Limit the listing to filesystems of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be specified by giving multiple `-t' options.
     By default, nothing is omitted.

`-T'
`--print-type'
     Print each filesystem's type.  The types printed here are the same
     ones you can include or exclude with `-t' and `-x'.  The particular
     types printed are whatever is supported by the system.  Here are
     some of the common names (this list is certainly not exhaustive):

    `nfs'
          An NFS filesystem, i.e., one mounted over a network from
          another machine.  This is the one type name which seems to be
          used uniformly by all systems.

    `4.2, ufs, efs...'
          A filesystem on a locally-mounted hard disk.  (The system
          might even support more than one type here; Linux does.)

    `hsfs, cdfs'
          A filesystem on a CD-ROM drive.  HP-UX uses `cdfs', most other
          systems use `hsfs' (`hs' for "High Sierra").

    `pcfs'
          An MS-DOS filesystem, usually on a diskette.


`-x FSTYPE'
`--exclude-type=FSTYPE'
     Limit the listing to filesystems not of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be eliminated by giving multiple `-x'
     options.  By default, no filesystem types are omitted.

`-v'
     Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of `df'.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: du invocation,  Next: stat invocation,  Prev: df invocation,  Up: Disk usage

`du': Estimate file space usage
===============================

   `du' reports the amount of disk space used by the specified files
and for each subdirectory (of directory arguments).  Synopsis:

     du [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   With no arguments, `du' reports the disk space for the current
directory.  Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes,
but this can be overridden (*note Block size::).  Non-integer
quantities are rounded up to the next higher unit.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--all'
     Show counts for all files, not just directories.

`--apparent-size'
     Print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage.  The apparent size
     of a file is the number of bytes reported by `wc -c' on regular
     files, or more generally, `ls -l --block-size=1' or `stat
     --format=%s'.  For example, a file containing the word `zoo' with
     no newline would, of course, have an apparent size of 3.  Such a
     small file may require anywhere from zero to 16 or more kilobytes
     of disk space, depending on the type and configuration of the file
     system on which the file resides.  However, a sparse file created
     with this command
          : | dd bs=1 seek=`echo '2^31'|bc` of=big
     has an apparent size of 2 gigabytes, yet on most modern systems,
     it actually uses almost no disk space.

`-b'
`--bytes'
     Equivalent to `--apparent-size --block-size=1'.

`-B SIZE'
`--block-size=SIZE'
     Scale sizes by SIZE before printing them (*note Block size::).
     For example, `-BG' prints sizes in units of 1,073,741,824 bytes.

`-c'
`--total'
     Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been
     processed.  This can be used to find out the total disk usage of a
     given set of files or directories.

`-D'
`--dereference-args'
     Dereference symbolic links that are command line arguments.  Does
     not affect other symbolic links.  This is helpful for finding out
     the disk usage of directories, such as `/usr/tmp', which are often
     symbolic links.

`-h'
`--human-readable'
     Append a size letter to each size, such as `M' for mebibytes.
     Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; `M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
     Use the `-H' or `--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

`-H'
`--si'
     Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as `MB' for
     megabytes.  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; `MB' stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the `-h' or `--human-readable' option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

`-k'
     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
     (*note Block size::).  This option is equivalent to
     `--block-size=1K'.

`-l'
`--count-links'
     Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared already
     (as a hard link).

`-L'
`--dereference'
     Dereference symbolic links (show the disk space used by the file
     or directory that the link points to instead of the space used by
     the link).

`--max-depth=DEPTH'
     Show the total for each directory (and file if -all) that is at
     most MAX_DEPTH levels down from the root of the hierarchy.  The
     root is at level 0, so `du --max-depth=0' is equivalent to `du -s'.

`-s'
`--summarize'
     Display only a total for each argument.

`-S'
`--separate-dirs'
     Report the size of each directory separately, not including the
     sizes of subdirectories.

`-x'
`--one-file-system'
     Skip directories that are on different filesystems from the one
     that the argument being processed is on.

`--exclude=PATTERN'
     When recursing, skip subdirectories or files matching PATTERN.
     For example, `du --exclude='*.o'' excludes files whose names end
     in `.o'.

`-X FILE'
`--exclude-from=FILE'
     Like `--exclude', except take the patterns to exclude from FILE,
     one per line.  If FILE is `-', take the patterns from standard
     input.


   On BSD systems, `du' reports sizes that are half the correct values
for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems.  On HP-UX systems,
it reports sizes that are twice the correct values for files that are
NFS-mounted from BSD systems.  This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also
affects the HP-UX `du' program.

`stat': Report file or filesystem status
========================================

   `stat' displays information about the specified file(s).  Synopsis:

     stat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   With no option, `stat' reports all information about the given files.
But it also can be used to report the information of the filesystems the
given files are located on. If the files are links, `stat' can also
give information about the files the links point to.

`-f'
`--filesystem'
     Report information about the filesystems where the given files are
     located instead of information about the files themselves.

`-L'
`--dereference'
     Change how `stat' treats symbolic links.  With this option, `stat'
     acts on the file referenced by each symbolic link argument.
     Without it, `stat' acts on any symbolic link argument directly.

`-t'
`--terse'
     Print the information in terse form, suitable for parsing by other
     programs.

`-c'
`--format'
     Allow user to specify the output format.

     Interpreted sequences for file stat are:
        * %a - Access rights in octal

        * %A - Access rights in human readable form

        * %b - Number of blocks allocated (see `%B')

        * %B - The size in bytes of each block reported by `%b'

        * %d - Device number in decimal

        * %D - Device number in hex

        * %f - raw mode in hex

        * %F - File type

        * %g - Group Id of owner

        * %G - Group name of owner

        * %h - Number of hard links

        * %i - Inode number

        * %n - File name

        * %N - Quoted File name with dereference if symbolic link

        * %o - IO block size

        * %s - Total size, in bytes

        * %t - Major device type in hex

        * %T - Minor device type in hex

        * %u - User Id of owner

        * %U - User name of owner

        * %x - Time of last access

        * %X - Time of last access as seconds since Epoch

        * %y - Time of last modification

        * %Y - Time of last modification as seconds since Epoch

        * %z - Time of last change

        * %Z - Time of last change as seconds since Epoch

     Interpreted sequences for filesystem stat are:
        * %n - File name

        * %i - File System id in hex

        * %l - Maximum length of filenames

        * %t - Type in hex

        * %T - Type in human readable form

        * %b - Total data blocks in file system

        * %f - Free blocks in file system

        * %a - Free blocks available to non-superuser

        * %s - Optimal transfer block size

        * %c - Total file nodes in file system


File: coreutils.info,  Node: sync invocation,  Prev: stat invocation,  Up: Disk usage

`sync': Synchronize data on disk with memory
============================================

   `sync' writes any data buffered in memory out to disk.  This can
include (but is not limited to) modified superblocks, modified inodes,
and delayed reads and writes.  This must be implemented by the kernel;
The `sync' program does nothing but exercise the `sync' system call.

   The kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow) disk
reads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer
crashes, data may be lost or the filesystem corrupted as a result.
`sync' ensures everything in memory is written to disk.

   Any arguments are ignored, except for a lone `--help' or `--version'
(*note Common options::).

`echo': Print a line of text
============================

   `echo' writes each given STRING to standard output, with a space
between each and a newline after the last one.  Synopsis:

     echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-n'
     Do not output the trailing newline.

`-e'
     Enable interpretation of the following backslash-escaped
     characters in each STRING:

    `\a'
          alert (bell)

File: coreutils.info,  Node: printf invocation,  Next: yes invocation,  Prev: echo invocation,  Up: Printing text

`printf': Format and print data
===============================

   `printf' does formatted printing of text. Synopsis:

     printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...

   `printf' prints the FORMAT string, interpreting `%' directives and
`\' escapes in the same way as the C `printf' function.  The FORMAT
argument is re-used as necessary to convert all of the given ARGUMENTs.

   `printf' has one additional directive, `%b', which prints its
argument string with `\' escapes interpreted in the same way as in the
FORMAT string.

   `printf' interprets `\OOO' in FORMAT as an octal number (if OOO is 0
to 3 octal digits) specifying a character to print, and `\xHH' as a
hexadecimal number (if HH is 1 to 2 hex digits) specifying a character
to print.

   `printf' interprets two character syntaxes introduced in ISO C 99:
`\u' for 16-bit Unicode characters, specified as 4 hex digits HHHH, and
`\U' for 32-bit Unicode characters, specified as 8 hex digits HHHHHHHH.
`printf' outputs the Unicode characters according to the LC_CTYPE part
of the current locale, i.e. depending on the values of the environment
variables `LC_ALL', `LC_CTYPE', `LANG'.

   The processing of `\u' and `\U' requires a full-featured `iconv'
facility. It is activated on systems with glibc 2.2 (or newer), or when
`libiconv' is installed prior to this package. Otherwise the use of
`\u' and `\U' will give an error message.

   An additional escape, `\c', causes `printf' to produce no further
output.

   The only options are a lone `--help' or `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

   The Unicode character syntaxes are useful for writing strings in a
locale independent way. For example, a string containing the Euro
currency symbol

     $ /usr/local/bin/printf '\u20AC 14.95'

will be output correctly in all locales supporting the Euro symbol
(ISO-8859-15, UTF-8, and others). Similarly, a Chinese string

     $ /usr/local/bin/printf '\u4e2d\u6587'

will be output correctly in all Chinese locales (GB2312, BIG5, UTF-8,
etc).

   Note that in these examples, the full pathname of `printf' has been
given, to distinguish it from the GNU `bash' builtin function `printf'.

   For larger strings, you don't need to look up the hexadecimal code
values of each character one by one. ASCII characters mixed with \u
escape sequences is also known as the JAVA source file encoding. You can
use GNU recode 3.5c (or newer) to convert strings to this encoding. Here
is how to convert a piece of text into a shell script which will output
this text in a locale-independent way:

     $ LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.big5 /usr/local/bin/printf \
         '\u4e2d\u6587\n' > sample.txt
     $ recode BIG5..JAVA < sample.txt \
         | sed -e "s|^|/usr/local/bin/printf '|" -e "s|$|\\\\n'|" \
         > sample.sh

File: coreutils.info,  Node: false invocation,  Next: true invocation,  Up: Conditions

`false': Do nothing, unsuccessfully
===================================

   `false' does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning
"failure".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
unsuccessful command is needed.

   By default, `false' honors the `--help' and `--version' options.
However, that is contrary to POSIX, so when the environment variable
`POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set, `false' ignores _all_ command line arguments,
including `--help' and `--version'.

   This version of `false' is implemented as a C program, and is thus
more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may
safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.

   Note that `false' (unlike all other programs documented herein)
exits unsuccessfully, even when invoked with `--help' or `--version'.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: true invocation,  Next: test invocation,  Prev: false invocation,  Up: Conditions

`true': Do nothing, successfully
================================

   `true' does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
"success".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:'
(colon) may do the same thing faster.  In most modern shells, `true' is
a built-in command, so when you use `true' in a script, you're probably
using the built-in command, not the one documented here.

   By default, `true' honors the `--help' and `--version' options.
However, that is contrary to POSIX, so when the environment variable
`POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set, `true' ignores _all_ command line arguments,
including `--help' and `--version'.

   This version of `true' is implemented as a C program, and is thus
more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may
safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.

`test': Check file types and compare values
===========================================

   `test' returns a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression EXPR.  Each part of the
expression must be a separate argument.

   `test' has file status checks, string operators, and numeric
comparison operators.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   Besides the options below, `test' accepts a lone `--help' or
`--version'.  *Note Common options::.  A single non-option argument is
also allowed: `test' returns true if the argument is not null.

`expr': Evaluate expressions
============================

   `expr' evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard
output.  Each token of the expression must be a separate argument.

   Operands are either numbers or strings.  `expr' converts anything
appearing in an operand position to an integer or a string depending on
the operation being applied to it.

   Strings are not quoted for `expr' itself, though you may need to
quote them to protect characters with special meaning to the shell,
e.g., spaces.

   Operators may be given as infix symbols or prefix keywords.
Parentheses may be used for grouping in the usual manner (you must
quote parentheses to avoid the shell evaluating them, however).

   Exit status:

     0 if the expression is neither null nor 0,
     1 if the expression is null or 0,
     2 for invalid expressions.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: String expressions,  Next: Numeric expressions,  Up: expr invocation

String expressions
------------------

   `expr' supports pattern matching and other string operators.  These
have lower precedence than both the numeric and relational operators (in
the next sections).

`STRING : REGEX'
     Perform pattern matching.  The arguments are converted to strings
     and the second is considered to be a (basic, a la GNU `grep')
     regular expression, with a `^' implicitly prepended.  The first
     argument is then matched against this regular expression.

     If the match succeeds and REGEX uses `\(' and `\)', the `:'
     expression returns the part of STRING that matched the
     subexpression; otherwise, it returns the number of characters
     matched.

     If the match fails, the `:' operator returns the null string if
     `\(' and `\)' are used in REGEX, otherwise 0.

     Only the first `\( ... \)' pair is relevant to the return value;
     additional pairs are meaningful only for grouping the regular
     expression operators.

     In the regular expression, `\+', `\?', and `\|' are operators
     which respectively match one or more, zero or one, or separate
     alternatives.  SunOS and other `expr''s treat these as regular
     characters.  (POSIX allows either behavior.)  *Note Regular
     Expression Library: (regex)Top, for details of regular expression
     syntax.  Some examples are in *Note Examples of expr::.

`match STRING REGEX'
     An alternative way to do pattern matching.  This is the same as
     `STRING : REGEX'.

`substr STRING POSITION LENGTH'
     Returns the substring of STRING beginning at POSITION with length
     at most LENGTH.  If either POSITION or LENGTH is negative, zero,
     or non-numeric, returns the null string.

`index STRING CHARSET'
     Returns the first position in STRING where the first character in
     CHARSET was found.  If no character in CHARSET is found in STRING,
     return 0.

`length STRING'
     Returns the length of STRING.

`+ TOKEN'
     Interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a keyword like MATCH or
     an operator like `/'.  This makes it possible to test `expr length
     + "$x"' or `expr + "$x" : '.*/\(.\)'' and have it do the right
     thing even if the value of $X happens to be (for example) `/' or
     `index'.  This operator is a GNU extension.  Portable shell
     scripts should use `" $token" : ' \(.*\)'' instead of `+ "$token"'.


   To make `expr' interpret keywords as strings, you must use the
`quote' operator.

Numeric expressions
-------------------

   `expr' supports the usual numeric operators, in order of increasing
precedence.  The string operators (previous section) have lower
precedence, the connectives (next section) have higher.

`+ -'
     Addition and subtraction.  Both arguments are converted to numbers;
     an error occurs if this cannot be done.

`* / %'
     Multiplication, division, remainder.  Both arguments are converted
     to numbers; an error occurs if this cannot be done.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Relations for expr,  Next: Examples of expr,  Prev: Numeric expressions,  Up: expr invocation

Relations for `expr'
--------------------

   `expr' supports the usual logical connectives and relations.  These
are higher precedence than either the string or numeric operators
(previous sections).  Here is the list, lowest-precedence operator
first.

`|'
     Returns its first argument if that is neither null nor 0,
     otherwise its second argument.

`&'
     Return its first argument if neither argument is null or 0,
     otherwise 0.

`< <= = == != >= >'
     Compare the arguments and return 1 if the relation is true, 0
     otherwise.  `==' is a synonym for `='.  `expr' first tries to
     convert both arguments to numbers and do a numeric comparison; if
     either conversion fails, it does a lexicographic comparison using
     the character collating sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE'
     locale.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: Examples of expr,  Prev: Relations for expr,  Up: expr invocation

Examples of using `expr'
------------------------

   Here are a few examples, including quoting for shell metacharacters.

   To add 1 to the shell variable `foo', in Bourne-compatible shells:
     foo=`expr $foo + 1`

   To print the non-directory part of the file name stored in `$fname',
which need not contain a `/'.
     expr $fname : '.*/\(.*\)' '|' $fname

   An example showing that `\+' is an operator:
     expr aaa : 'a\+'
     => 3

     expr abc : 'a\(.\)c'
     => b
     expr index abcdef cz
     => 3
     expr index index a
     error--> expr: syntax error
     expr index quote index a
     => 0

Redirection
***********

   Unix shells commonly provide several forms of "redirection"--ways to
change the input source or output destination of a command.  But one
useful redirection is performed by a separate command, not by the shell;
it's described here.

* Menu:

* tee invocation::              Redirect output to multiple files.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: tee invocation,  Up: Redirection

`tee': Redirect output to multiple files
========================================

   The `tee' command copies standard input to standard output and also
to any files given as arguments.  This is useful when you want not only
to send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy.  Synopsis:

     tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created.
If a file being written to already exists, the data it previously
contained is overwritten unless the `-a' option is used.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--append'
     Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting
     them.

`-i'
`--ignore-interrupts'
     Ignore interrupt signals.

File name manipulation
**********************

   This section describes commands that manipulate file names.

* Menu:

* basename invocation::         Strip directory and suffix from a file name.
* dirname invocation::          Strip non-directory suffix from a file name.
* pathchk invocation::          Check file name portability.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: basename invocation,  Next: dirname invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`basename': Strip directory and suffix from a file name
=======================================================

   `basename' removes any leading directory components from NAME.
Synopsis:

     basename NAME [SUFFIX]

   If SUFFIX is specified and is identical to the end of NAME, it is
removed from NAME as well.  `basename' prints the result on standard
output.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: dirname invocation,  Next: pathchk invocation,  Prev: basename invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`dirname': Strip non-directory suffix from a file name
======================================================

   `dirname' prints all but the final slash-delimited component of a
string (presumably a filename).  Synopsis:

     dirname NAME

   If NAME is a single component, `dirname' prints `.' (meaning the
current directory).

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: pathchk invocation,  Prev: dirname invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`pathchk': Check file name portability
======================================

   `pathchk' checks portability of filenames.  Synopsis:

     pathchk [OPTION]... NAME...

   For each NAME, `pathchk' prints a message if any of these conditions
is true:
  1. one of the existing directories in NAME does not have search
     (execute) permission,

  2. the length of NAME is larger than its filesystem's maximum file
     name length,

  3. the length of one component of NAME, corresponding to an existing
     directory name, is larger than its filesystem's maximum length for
     a file name component.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-p'
`--portability'
     Instead of performing length checks on the underlying filesystem,
     test the length of each file name and its components against the
     POSIX minimum limits for portability.  Also check that the file
     name contains no characters not in the portable file name
     character set.


   Exit status:

     0 if all specified file names passed all of the tests,
     1 otherwise.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Working context,  Next: User information,  Prev: File name manipulation,  Up: Top

Working context
***************

   This section describes commands that display or alter the context in
which you are working: the current directory, the terminal settings, and
so forth.  See also the user-related commands in the next section.

* Menu:

* pwd invocation::              Print working directory.
* stty invocation::             Print or change terminal characteristics.
* printenv invocation::         Print environment variables.
* tty invocation::              Print file name of terminal on standard input.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: pwd invocation,  Next: stty invocation,  Up: Working context

`pwd': Print working directory
==============================

   `pwd' prints the fully resolved name of the current directory.  That
is, all components of the printed name will be actual directory
names--none will be symbolic links.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The only options are a lone `--help' or `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: stty invocation,  Next: printenv invocation,  Prev: pwd invocation,  Up: Working context

`stty': Print or change terminal characteristics
================================================

   `stty' prints or changes terminal characteristics, such as baud rate.
Synopses:

     stty [OPTION] [SETTING]...
     stty [OPTION]

   If given no line settings, `stty' prints the baud rate, line
discipline number (on systems that support it), and line settings that
have been changed from the values set by `stty sane'.  By default, mode
reading and setting are performed on the tty line connected to standard
input, although this can be modified by the `--file' option.

   `stty' accepts many non-option arguments that change aspects of the
terminal line operation, as described below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--all'
     Print all current settings in human-readable form.  This option
     may not be used in combination with any line settings.

`-F DEVICE'
`--file=DEVICE'
     Set the line opened by the filename specified in DEVICE instead of
     the tty line connected to standard input.  This option is necessary
     because opening a POSIX tty requires use of the `O_NONDELAY' flag
     to prevent a POSIX tty from blocking until the carrier detect line
     is high if the `clocal' flag is not set.  Hence, it is not always
     possible to allow the shell to open the device in the traditional
     manner.

`-g'
`--save'
     Print all current settings in a form that can be used as an
     argument to another `stty' command to restore the current
     settings.  This option may not be used in combination with any
     line settings.


   Many settings can be turned off by preceding them with a `-'.  Such
arguments are marked below with "May be negated" in their description.
The descriptions themselves refer to the positive case, that is, when
_not_ negated (unless stated otherwise, of course).

   Some settings are not available on all POSIX systems, since they use
extensions.  Such arguments are marked below with "Non-POSIX" in their
description.  On non-POSIX systems, those or other settings also may not
be available, but it's not feasible to document all the variations: just
try it and see.

Special characters
------------------

   The special characters' default values vary from system to system.
They are set with the syntax `name value', where the names are listed
below and the value can be given either literally, in hat notation
(`^C'), or as an integer which may start with `0x' to indicate
hexadecimal, `0' to indicate octal, or any other digit to indicate
decimal.

   For GNU stty, giving a value of `^-' or `undef' disables that
special character.  (This is incompatible with Ultrix `stty', which
uses  a value of `u' to disable a special character.  GNU `stty' treats
a value `u' like any other, namely to set that special character to
<U>.)

`intr'
     Send an interrupt signal.

`quit'
     Send a quit signal.

`erase'
     Erase the last character typed.

`kill'
     Erase the current line.

`eof'
     Send an end of file (terminate the input).

`eol'
     End the line.

`eol2'
     Alternate character to end the line.  Non-POSIX.

`swtch'
     Switch to a different shell layer.  Non-POSIX.

`start'
     Restart the output after stopping it.

`stop'
     Stop the output.

`susp'
     Send a terminal stop signal.

`dsusp'
     Send a terminal stop signal after flushing the input.  Non-POSIX.

`rprnt'
     Redraw the current line.  Non-POSIX.

`werase'
     Erase the last word typed.  Non-POSIX.

`lnext'
     Enter the next character typed literally, even if it is a special
     character.  Non-POSIX.

`size'
     Print the number of rows and columns that the kernel thinks the

`logname': Print current login name
===================================

   `logname' prints the calling user's name, as found in the file
`/etc/utmp', and exits with a status of 0.  If there is no `/etc/utmp'
entry for the calling process, `logname' prints an error message and
exits with a status of 1.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

`whoami': Print effective user id
=================================

   `whoami' prints the user name associated with the current effective
user id.  It is equivalent to the command `id -un'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

`groups': Print group names a user is in
========================================

   `groups' prints the names of the primary and any supplementary
groups for each given USERNAME, or the current process if no names are
given.  If names are given, the name of each user is printed before the
list of that user's groups.  Synopsis:

     groups [USERNAME]...

   The group lists are equivalent to the output of the command `id -Gn'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: users invocation,  Next: who invocation,  Prev: groups invocation,  Up: User information

`users': Print login names of users currently logged in
=======================================================

   `users' prints on a single line a blank-separated list of user names
of users currently logged in to the current host.  Each user name
corresponds to a login session, so if a user has more than one login
session, that user's name will appear the same number of times in the
output. Synopsis:

     users [FILE]

   With no FILE argument, `users' extracts its information from the
file `/etc/utmp'.  If a file argument is given, `users' uses that file
instead.  A common choice is `/etc/wtmp'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: who invocation,  Prev: users invocation,  Up: User information

`who': Print who is currently logged in
=======================================

   `who' prints information about users who are currently logged on.
Synopsis:

     `who' [OPTION] [FILE] [am i]

   If given no non-option arguments, `who' prints the following
information for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal
line, login time, and remote hostname or X display.

   If given one non-option argument, `who' uses that instead of
`/etc/utmp' as the name of the file containing the record of users
logged on.  `/etc/wtmp' is commonly given as an argument to `who' to
look at who has previously logged on.

   If given two non-option arguments, `who' prints only the entry for
the user running it (determined from its standard input), preceded by
the hostname.  Traditionally, the two arguments given are `am i', as in
`who am i'.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-m'
     Same as `who am i'.

`-q'
`--count'
     Print only the login names and the number of users logged on.
     Overrides all other options.

`-s'
     Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of `who'.

`-i'
`-u'
`--idle'
     After the login time, print the number of hours and minutes that
     the user has been idle.  `.' means the user was active in last
     minute.  `old' means the user was idle for more than 24 hours.

`-l'
`--lookup'
     Attempt to canonicalize hostnames found in utmp through a DNS
     lookup.  This is not the default because it can cause significant
     delays on systems with automatic dial-up internet access.

`-H'
`--heading'
     Print a line of column headings.

`-w'
`-T'
`--mesg'
`--message'
`--writable'
     After each login name print a character indicating the user's
     message status:

          `+' allowing `write' messages
          `-' disallowing `write' messages
          `?' cannot find terminal device

=========================================

   Synopses:

     date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
     date [-u|--utc|--universal] [ MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss] ]

   Invoking `date' with no FORMAT argument is equivalent to invoking
`date '+%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y''.

   If given an argument that starts with a `+', `date' prints the
current time and date (or the time and date specified by the `--date'
option, see below) in the format defined by that argument, which is the
same as in the `strftime' function.  Except for directives, which start
with `%', characters in the format string are printed unchanged.  The
directives are described below.

     seconds since the epoch, i.e., 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC (a GNU
     extension).  Note that this value is the number of seconds between
     the epoch and the current date as defined by the localtime system
     call.  It isn't changed by the `--date' option.

     belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.

`%G'
     The year corresponding to the ISO week number.  This has the same
     format and value as `%Y', except that if the ISO week number (see

     Days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are in week zero.

`%V'
     week number of year with Monday as first day of the week as a
     decimal (01...53). If the week containing January 1 has four or

`%%'
     a literal %

`%n'
     a newline

`%t'
     a horizontal tab


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Padding,  Next: Setting the time,  Prev: Literal directives,  Up: date invocation

Padding
-------

   By default, `date' pads numeric fields with zeroes, so that, for
example, numeric months are always output as two digits. GNU `date'
recognizes the following numeric modifiers between the `%' and the
directive.

`-'
     (hyphen) do not pad the field; useful if the output is intended for
     human consumption.

`_'
     (underscore) pad the field with spaces; useful if you need a fixed
     number of characters in the output, but zeroes are too distracting.

These are GNU extensions.

   Here is an example illustrating the differences:

     date +%d/%m -d "Feb 1"
     => 01/02
     date +%-d/%-m -d "Feb 1"
     => 1/2
     date +%_d/%_m -d "Feb 1"
     =>  1/ 2


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Setting the time,  Next: Options for date,  Prev: Padding,  Up: date invocation

Setting the time
----------------

   If given an argument that does not start with `+', `date' sets the
system clock to the time and date specified by that argument (as
described below).  You must have appropriate privileges to set the
system clock.  The `--date' and `--set' options may not be used with
such an argument.  The `--universal' option may be used with such an
argument to indicate that the specified time and date are relative to
Coordinated Universal Time rather than to the local time zone.

   The argument must consist entirely of digits, which have the
following meaning:

`MM'
     month

`DD'
     day within month

`hh'
     hour

`mm'
     minute

`CC'
     first two digits of year (optional)

`YY'
     last two digits of year (optional)

`ss'
     second (optional)

   The `--set' option also sets the system clock; see the next section.

Options for `date'
------------------

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-d DATESTR'
`--date=DATESTR'
     Display the time and date specified in DATESTR instead of the
     current time and date.  DATESTR can be in almost any common
     format.  It can contain month names, time zones, `am' and `pm',
     `yesterday', `ago', `next', etc.  *Note Date input formats::.

`-f DATEFILE'
`--file=DATEFILE'
     Parse each line in DATEFILE as with `-d' and display the resulting
     time and date.  If DATEFILE is `-', use standard input.  This is
     useful when you have many dates to process, because the system
     overhead of starting up the `date' executable many times can be
     considerable.

`-I TIMESPEC'
`--iso-8601[=TIMESPEC]'
     Display the date using the ISO 8601 format, `%Y-%m-%d'.

     The argument TIMESPEC specifies the number of additional terms of
     the time to include.  It can be one of the following:
    `auto'
          The default behavior: print just the date.

    `hours'
          Append the hour of the day to the date.

    `minutes'
          Append the hours and minutes.

    `seconds'
          Append the hours, minutes, and seconds.

     If showing any time terms, then include the time zone using the
     format `%z'.

     If TIMESPEC is omitted with `--iso-8601', the default is `auto'.
     On older systems, GNU `date' instead supports an obsolete option
     `-I[TIMESPEC]', where TIMESPEC defaults to `auto'.  POSIX
     1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::) does not allow `-I'
     without an argument; use `--iso-8601' instead.

`-R'
`--rfc-822'
     Display the time and date using the RFC-822-conforming format,
     `%a, %_d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'.

`-r FILE'
`--reference=FILE'
     Display the time and date reference according to the last
     modification time of FILE, instead of the current time and date.

`-s DATESTR'
`--set=DATESTR'
     Set the time and date to DATESTR.  See `-d' above.

`-u'
`--utc'
`--universal'
     Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by operating as if the `TZ'
     environment variable were set to the string `UTC0'.  Normally,
     `date' operates in the time zone indicated by `TZ', or the system
     default if `TZ' is not set.  Coordinated Universal Time is often
     called "Greenwich Mean Time" (GMT) for historical reasons.

Examples of `date'
------------------

   Here are a few examples.  Also see the documentation for the `-d'
option in the previous section.

   * To print the date of the day before yesterday:

          date --date='2 days ago'

   * To print the date of the day three months and one day hence:
          date --date='3 months 1 day'

   * To print the day of year of Christmas in the current year:
          date --date='25 Dec' +%j

   * To print the current full month name and the day of the month:
          date '+%B %d'

     But this may not be what you want because for the first nine days
     of the month, the `%d' expands to a zero-padded two-digit field,
     for example `date -d 1may '+%B %d'' will print `May 01'.

   * To print a date without the leading zero for one-digit days of the
     month, you can use the (GNU extension) `-' modifier to suppress
     the padding altogether.
          date -d 1may '+%B %-d

   * To print the current date and time in the format required by many
     non-GNU versions of `date' when setting the system clock:
          date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S

   * To set the system clock forward by two minutes:
          date --set='+2 minutes'

   * To print the date in the format specified by RFC-822, use `date
     --rfc'.  I just did and saw this:

          Mon, 25 Mar 1996 23:34:17 -0600

   * To convert a date string to the number of seconds since the epoch
     (which is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), use the `--date' option with
     the `%s' format.  That can be useful in sorting and/or graphing
     and/or comparing data by date.  The following command outputs the
     number of the seconds since the epoch for the time two minutes
     after the epoch:

          date --date='1970-01-01 00:02:00 +0000' +%s
          120

     If you do not specify time zone information in the date string,
     `date' uses your computer's idea of the time zone when
     interpreting the string.  For example, if your computer's time
     zone is that of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was then 5 hours
     (i.e., 18,000 seconds) behind UTC:

          # local time zone used
          date --date='1970-01-01 00:02:00' +%s
          18120

   * If you're sorting or graphing dated data, your raw date values may
     be represented as seconds since the epoch.  But few people can
     look at the date `946684800' and casually note "Oh, that's the
     first second of the year 2000 in Greenwich, England."

          date --date='2000-01-01 UTC' +%s
          946684800

     To convert such an unwieldy number of seconds back to a more
     readable form, use a command like this:

          # local time zone used
          date -d '1970-01-01 UTC 946684800 seconds' +"%Y-%m-%d %T %z"
          1999-12-31 19:00:00 -0500

File: coreutils.info,  Node: chroot invocation,  Next: env invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`chroot': Run a command with a different root directory
=======================================================

   `chroot' runs a command with a specified root directory.  On many
systems, only the super-user can do this.  Synopses:

     chroot NEWROOT [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     chroot OPTION

   Ordinarily, filenames are looked up starting at the root of the
directory structure, i.e., `/'.  `chroot' changes the root to the
directory NEWROOT (which must exist) and then runs COMMAND with
optional ARGS.  If COMMAND is not specified, the default is the value
of the `SHELL' environment variable or `/bin/sh' if not set, invoked
with the `-i' option.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

   Here are a few tips to help avoid common problems in using chroot.
To start with a simple example, make COMMAND refer to a statically
linked binary.  If you were to use a dynamically linked executable, then
you'd have to arrange to have the shared libraries in the right place
under your new root directory.

   For example, if you create a statically linked `ls' executable, and
put it in /tmp/empty, you can run this command as root:

     $ chroot /tmp/empty /ls -Rl /

   Then you'll see output like this:

     /:
     total 1023
     -rwxr-xr-x    1 0        0         1041745 Aug 16 11:17 ls

   If you want to use a dynamically linked executable, say `bash', then
first run `ldd bash' to see what shared objects it needs.  Then, in
addition to copying the actual binary, also copy the listed files to
the required positions under your intended new root directory.
Finally, if the executable requires any other files (e.g., data, state,
device files), copy them into place, too.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: env invocation,  Next: nice invocation,  Prev: chroot invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`env': Run a command in a modified environment
==============================================

   `env' runs a command with a modified environment.  Synopses:

     env [OPTION]... [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     env

   Arguments of the form `VARIABLE=VALUE' set the environment variable
VARIABLE to value VALUE.  VALUE may be empty (`VARIABLE=').  Setting a
variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

   The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke;
it is searched for according to the `PATH' environment variable.  Any
remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.

   If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed.  This is like
specifying a command name of `printenv'.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-u NAME'
`--unset=NAME'
     Remove variable NAME from the environment, if it was in the
     environment.

`-'
`-i'
`--ignore-environment'
     Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited
     environment.

`nice': Run a command with modified scheduling priority
=======================================================

   `nice' prints or modifies the scheduling priority of a job.
Synopsis:

     nice [OPTION]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]

   If no arguments are given, `nice' prints the current scheduling
priority, which it inherited.  Otherwise, `nice' runs the given COMMAND
with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If no ADJUSTMENT is given, the
priority of the command is incremented by 10.  You must have
appropriate privileges to specify a negative adjustment.  The priority
can be adjusted by `nice' over the range of -20 (the highest priority)
to 19 (the lowest).

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-n ADJUSTMENT'
`--adjustment=ADJUSTMENT'
     Add ADJUSTMENT instead of 10 to the command's priority.

     On older systems, `nice' supports an obsolete option
     `-ADJUSTMENT'.  POSIX 1003.1-2001 (*note Standards conformance::)
     does not allow this; use `-n ADJUSTMENT' instead.



File: coreutils.info,  Node: nohup invocation,  Next: su invocation,  Prev: nice invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`nohup': Run a command immune to hangups
========================================

   `nohup' runs the given COMMAND with hangup signals ignored, so that
the command can continue running in the background after you log out.
Synopsis:

     nohup COMMAND [ARG]...

   If standard output is a terminal, it is redirected so that it is
appended to the file `nohup.out'; if that cannot be written to, it is
appended to the file `$HOME/nohup.out'.  If that cannot be written to,
the command is not run.

   If `nohup' creates either `nohup.out' or `$HOME/nohup.out', it
creates it with no "group" or "other" access permissions.  It does not
change the permissions if the output file already existed.

   If standard error is a terminal, it is redirected to the same file
descriptor as the standard output.

   `nohup' does not automatically put the command it runs in the
background; you must do that explicitly, by ending the command line
with an `&'.  Also, `nohup' does not change the scheduling priority of
COMMAND; use `nice' for that, e.g., `nohup nice COMMAND'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

   Exit status:

     126 if COMMAND was found but could not be invoked
     127 if `nohup' itself failed or if COMMAND could not be found
     the exit status of COMMAND otherwise


File: coreutils.info,  Node: su invocation,  Prev: nohup invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`su': Run a command with substitute user and group id
=====================================================

   `su' allows one user to temporarily become another user.  It runs a
command (often an interactive shell) with the real and effective user
id, group id, and supplemental groups of a given USER. Synopsis:

     su [OPTION]... [USER [ARG]...]

   If no USER is given, the default is `root', the super-user.  The
shell to use is taken from USER's `passwd' entry, or `/bin/sh' if none
is specified there.  If USER has a password, `su' prompts for the
password unless run by a user with effective user id of zero (the
super-user).

   By default, `su' does not change the current directory.  It sets the
environment variables `HOME' and `SHELL' from the password entry for
USER, and if USER is not the super-user, sets `USER' and `LOGNAME' to
USER.  By default, the shell is not a login shell.

   Any additional ARGs are passed as additional arguments to the shell.

   GNU `su' does not treat `/bin/sh' or any other shells specially
(e.g., by setting `argv[0]' to `-su', passing `-c' only to certain
shells, etc.).

   `su' can optionally be compiled to use `syslog' to report failed,
and optionally successful, `su' attempts.  (If the system supports
`syslog'.)  However, GNU `su' does not check if the user is a member of
the `wheel' group; see below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c COMMAND'
`--command=COMMAND'
     Pass COMMAND, a single command line to run, to the shell with a
     `-c' option instead of starting an interactive shell.

`-f'
`--fast'
     Pass the `-f' option to the shell.  This probably only makes sense
     if the shell run is `csh' or `tcsh', for which the `-f' option
     prevents reading the startup file (`.cshrc').  With Bourne-like
     shells, the `-f' option disables file name pattern expansion
     (globbing), which is not likely to be useful.

`-'
`-l'
`--login'
     Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all
     environment variables except `TERM', `HOME', and `SHELL' (which
     are set as described above), and `USER' and `LOGNAME' (which are
     set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set `PATH'
     to a compiled-in default value.  Change to USER's home directory.
     Prepend `-' to the shell's name, intended to make it read its
     login startup file(s).

`-m'
`-p'
`--preserve-environment'
     Do not change the environment variables `HOME', `USER', `LOGNAME',
     or `SHELL'.  Run the shell given in the environment variable
     `SHELL' instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless the
     user running `su' is not the superuser and USER's shell is
     restricted.  A "restricted shell" is one that is not listed in the
     file `/etc/shells', or in a compiled-in list if that file does not
     exist.  Parts of what this option does can be overridden by
     `--login' and `--shell'.

`-s SHELL'
`--shell=SHELL'
     Run SHELL instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless
     the user running `su' is not the superuser and USER's shell is
     restricted (see `-m' just above).


Why GNU `su' does not support the `wheel' group
===============================================

   (This section is by Richard Stallman.)

   Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the
rest.  For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to
seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and
keeping it secret from everyone else.  (I was able to thwart this coup
and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't
know how to do that in Unix.)

   However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone.  Under the usual
`su' mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes
with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest.  The "wheel
group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of
the rulers.

   I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers.  If you are
used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you
might find this idea strange at first.

* Menu:

* kill invocation::             Sending a signal to processes.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: kill invocation,  Up: Process control

`kill': Send a signal to processes
==================================

   The `kill' command sends a signal to processes, causing them to
terminate or otherwise act upon receiving the signal in some way.
Alternatively, it lists information about signals.  Synopses:

     kill [-s SIGNAL | --signal SIGNAL | -SIGNAL] PID...
     kill [-l | --list | -t | --table] [SIGNAL]...

   The first form of the `kill' command sends a signal to all PID
arguments.  The default signal to send if none is specified is `TERM'.
The special signal number `0' does not denote a valid signal, but can
be used to test whether the PID arguments specify processes to which a
signal could be sent.

   If PID is positive, the signal is sent to the process with the
process id PID.  If PID is zero, the signal is sent to all processes in
the process group of the current process.  If PID is -1, the signal is
sent to all processes for which the user has permission to send a
signal.  If PID is less than -1, the signal is sent to all processes in
the process group that equals the absolute value of PID.

   If PID is not positive, a system-dependent set of system processes
is excluded from the list of processes to which the signal is sent.

   If a negative PID argument is desired as the first one, either a
signal must be specified as well, or the option parsing must be
interrupted with `-' before the first PID argument.  The following
three commands are equivalent:

     kill -15 -1
     kill -TERM -1
     kill -- -1

   The first form of the `kill' command succeeds if every PID argument
specifies at least one process that the signal was sent to.

   The second form of the `kill' command lists signal information.
Either the `-l' or `--list' option, or the `-t' or `--table' option
must be specified.  Without any SIGNAL argument, all supported signals
are listed.  The output of `-l' or `--list' is a list of the signal
names, one per line; if SIGNAL is already a name, the signal number is
printed instead.  The output of `-t' or `--table' is a table of signal
numbers, names, and descriptions.  This form of the `kill' command
succeeds if all SIGNAL arguments are valid and if there is no output
error.

   The `kill' command also supports the `--help' and `--version'
options.  *Note Common options::.

   A SIGNAL may be a signal name like `HUP', or a signal number like
`1', or an exit status of a process terminated by the signal.  A signal
name can be given in canonical form or prefixed by `SIG'.  The case of
the letters is ignored, except for the `-SIGNAL' option which must use
upper case to avoid ambiguity with lower case option letters.  The
following signal names and numbers are supported on all POSIX compliant
systems:

`HUP'
     1.  Hangup.

`INT'
     2.  Terminal interrupt.

`QUIT'
     3.  Terminal quit.

`ABRT'
     6.  Process abort.

`KILL'
     9.  Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).

`ALRM'
     14.  Alarm Clock.

`TERM'
     15.  Termination.

Other supported signal names have system-dependent corresponding
numbers.  All systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001 also support the
following signals:

`BUS'
     Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.

`CHLD'
     Child process terminated, stopped, or continued.

`CONT'
     Continue executing, if stopped.

`FPE'
     Erroneous arithmetic operation.

`ILL'
     Illegal Instruction.

`PIPE'
     Write on a pipe with no one to read it.

`SEGV'
     Invalid memory reference.

`STOP'
     Stop executing (cannot be caught or ignored).

`TSTP'
     Terminal stop.

`TTIN'
     Background process attempting read.

`TTOU'
     Background process attempting write.

`URG'
     High bandwidth data is available at a socket.

`USR1'
     User-defined signal 1.

`USR2'
     User-defined signal 2.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XSI extension also support
the following signals:

`POLL'
     Pollable event.

`PROF'
     Profiling timer expired.

`SYS'
     Bad system call.

`TRAP'
     Trace/breakpoint trap.

`VTALRM'
     Virtual timer expired.

`XCPU'
     CPU time limit exceeded.

`XFSZ'
     File size limit exceeded.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XRT extension also support
at least eight real-time signals called `RTMIN', `RTMIN+1', ...,
`RTMAX-1', `RTMAX'.

`factor': Print prime factors
=============================

   `factor' prints prime factors.  Synopses:

     factor [NUMBER]...
     factor OPTION

   If no NUMBER is specified on the command line, `factor' reads
numbers from standard input, delimited by newlines, tabs, or spaces.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

   The algorithm it uses is not very sophisticated, so for some inputs
`factor' runs for a long time.  The hardest numbers to factor are the
products of large primes.  Factoring the product of the two largest
32-bit prime numbers takes over 10 minutes of CPU time on a 400MHz
Pentium II.

     $ p=`echo '4294967279 * 4294967291'|bc`
     $ factor $p
     18446743979220271189: 4294967279 4294967291

File: coreutils.info,  Node: seq invocation,  Prev: factor invocation,  Up: Numeric operations

`seq': Print numeric sequences
==============================

   `seq' prints a sequence of numbers to standard output.  Synopses:

     seq [OPTION]... [FIRST [INCREMENT]] LAST...

   `seq' prints the numbers from FIRST to LAST by INCREMENT.  By
default, FIRST and INCREMENT are both 1, and each number is printed on
its own line.  All numbers can be reals, not just integers.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     Print all numbers using FORMAT; default `%g'.  FORMAT must contain
     exactly one of the floating point output formats `%e', `%f', or
     `%g'.

`-s STRING'
`--separator=STRING'
     Separate numbers with STRING; default is a newline.  The output
     always terminates with a newline.

`-w'
`--equal-width'
     Print all numbers with the same width, by padding with leading
     zeroes.  (To have other kinds of padding, use `--format').


   If you want to use `seq' to print sequences of large integer values,
don't use the default `%g' format since it can result in loss of
precision:

     $ seq 1000000 1000001
     1e+06
     1e+06

   Instead, you can use the format, `%1.f', to print large decimal
numbers with no exponent and no decimal point.

     $ seq --format=%1.f 1000000 1000001
     1000000
     1000001

   If you want hexadecimal output, you can use `printf' to perform the
conversion:

     $ printf %x'\n' `seq -f %1.f 1048575 1024 1050623`
     fffff
     1003ff
     1007ff

   For very long lists of numbers, use xargs to avoid system
limitations on the length of an argument list:

     $ seq -f %1.f 1000000 | xargs printf %x'\n' | tail -n 3
     f423e
     f423f
     f4240

   To generate octal output, use the printf `%o' format instead of
`%x'.  Note however that using printf works only for numbers smaller
than `2^32':

     $ printf "%x\n" `seq -f %1.f 4294967295 4294967296`
     ffffffff
     bash: printf: 4294967296: Numerical result out of range

   On most systems, seq can produce whole-number output for values up to
`2^53', so here's a more general approach to base conversion that also
happens to be more robust for such large numbers.  It works by using
`bc' and setting its output radix variable, OBASE, to `16' in this case
to produce hexadecimal output.

     $ (echo obase=16; seq -f %1.f 4294967295 4294967296)|bc
     FFFFFFFF
     100000000

   Be careful when using `seq' with a fractional INCREMENT, otherwise
you may see surprising results.  Most people would expect to see `0.3'
printed as the last number in this example:

     $ seq -s' ' 0 .1 .3
     0 0.1 0.2

   But that doesn't happen on most systems because `seq' is implemented
using binary floating point arithmetic (via the C `double' type) -
which means some decimal numbers like `.1' cannot be represented
exactly.  That in turn means some nonintuitive conditions like `.1 * 3
> .3' will end up being true.

   To work around that in the above example, use a slightly larger
number as the LAST value:

     $ seq -s' ' 0 .1 .31
     0 0.1 0.2 0.3

   In general, when using an INCREMENT with a fractional part, where
(LAST - FIRST) / INCREMENT is (mathematically) a whole number, specify
a slightly larger (or smaller, if INCREMENT is negative) value for LAST
to ensure that LAST is the final value printed by seq.

File permissions
****************

   Each file has a set of "permissions" that control the kinds of
access that users have to that file.  The permissions for a file are
also called its "access mode".  They can be represented either in
symbolic form or as an octal number.

* Menu:

* Mode Structure::              Structure of file permissions.
* Symbolic Modes::              Mnemonic permissions representation.
* Numeric Modes::               Permissions as octal numbers.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Mode Structure,  Next: Symbolic Modes,  Up: File permissions

Structure of File Permissions
=============================

   There are three kinds of permissions that a user can have for a file:

  1. permission to read the file.  For directories, this means
     permission to list the contents of the directory.

  2. permission to write to (change) the file.  For directories, this
     means permission to create and remove files in the directory.

  3. permission to execute the file (run it as a program).  For
     directories, this means permission to access files in the
     directory.

   There are three categories of users who may have different
permissions to perform any of the above operations on a file:

  1. the file's owner;

  2. other users who are in the file's group;

  3. everyone else.

   Files are given an owner and group when they are created.  Usually
the owner is the current user and the group is the group of the
directory the file is in, but this varies with the operating system, the
filesystem the file is created on, and the way the file is created.  You
can change the owner and group of a file by using the `chown' and
`chgrp' commands.

   In addition to the three sets of three permissions listed above, a
file's permissions have three special components, which affect only
executable files (programs) and, on some systems, directories:

  1. set the process's effective user ID to that of the file upon
     execution (called the "setuid bit").  No effect on directories.

  2. set the process's effective group ID to that of the file upon
     execution (called the "setgid bit").  For directories on some
     systems, put files created in the directory into the same group as
     the directory, no matter what group the user who creates them is
     in.

  3. save the program's text image on the swap device so it will load
     more quickly when run (called the "sticky bit").  For directories
     on some systems, prevent users from removing or renaming a file in
     a directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is
     called the "restricted deletion flag" for the directory.

   In addition to the permissions listed above, there may be file
attributes specific to the filesystem, e.g: access control lists
(ACLs), whether a file is compressed, whether a file can be modified
(immutability), whether a file can be dumped.  These are usually set
using programs specific to the filesystem.  For example:

ext2
     On GNU and Linux/GNU the file permissions ("attributes") specific
     to the ext2 filesystem are set using `chattr'.

FFS
     On FreeBSD the file permissions ("flags") specific to the FFS
     filesystem are set using `chrflags'.

   Although a file's permission "bits" allow an operation on that file,
that operation may still fail, because:

   * the filesystem-specific permissions do not permit it;

   * the filesystem is mounted as read-only.

   For example, if the immutable attribute is set on a file, it cannot
be modified, regardless of the fact that you may have just run `chmod
a+w FILE'.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Symbolic Modes,  Next: Numeric Modes,  Prev: Mode Structure,  Up: File permissions

Symbolic Modes
==============

   "Symbolic modes" represent changes to files' permissions as
operations on single-character symbols.  They allow you to modify either
all or selected parts of files' permissions, optionally based on their
previous values, and perhaps on the current `umask' as well (*note
Umask and Protection::).

   The format of symbolic modes is:

     [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXstugo...]...][,...]

symbolic modes.

File: coreutils.info,  Node: Setting Permissions,  Next: Copying Permissions,  Up: Symbolic Modes

Setting Permissions
-------------------

   The basic symbolic operations on a file's permissions are adding,
removing, and setting the permission that certain users have to read,
write, and execute the file.  These operations have the following
format:

     USERS OPERATION PERMISSIONS

The spaces between the three parts above are shown for readability only;
symbolic modes cannot contain spaces.

   The USERS part tells which users' access to the file is changed.  It
consists of one or more of the following letters (or it can be empty;
*note Umask and Protection::, for a description of what happens then).
When more than one of these letters is given, the order that they are
in does not matter.

`u'
     the user who owns the file;

`g'
     other users who are in the file's group;

`o'
     all other users;

`a'
     all users; the same as `ugo'.

   The OPERATION part tells how to change the affected users' access to
the file, and is one of the following symbols:

`+'
     to add the PERMISSIONS to whatever permissions the USERS already
     have for the file;

`-'
     to remove the PERMISSIONS from whatever permissions the USERS
     already have for the file;

`='
     to make the PERMISSIONS the only permissions that the USERS have
     for the file.

   The PERMISSIONS part tells what kind of access to the file should be
changed; it is zero or more of the following letters.  As with the
USERS part, the order does not matter when more than one letter is
given.  Omitting the PERMISSIONS part is useful only with the `='
operation, where it gives the specified USERS no access at all to the
file.

`r'
     the permission the USERS have to read the file;

`w'
     the permission the USERS have to write to the file;

`x'
     the permission the USERS have to execute the file.

   For example, to give everyone permission to read and write a file,
but not to execute it, use:

     a=rw

   To remove write permission for from all users other than the file's
owner, use:

     go-w

The above command does not affect the access that the owner of the file
has to it, nor does it affect whether other users can read or execute
the file.

   To give everyone except a file's owner no permission to do anything
with that file, use the mode below.  Other users could still remove the
file, if they have write permission on the directory it is in.

     go=

Another way to specify the same thing is:

     og-rxw


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Copying Permissions,  Next: Changing Special Permissions,  Prev: Setting Permissions,  Up: Symbolic Modes

Copying Existing Permissions
----------------------------

   You can base a file's permissions on its existing permissions.  To do
this, instead of using `r', `w', or `x' after the operator, you use the
letter `u', `g', or `o'.  For example, the mode
     o+g

adds the permissions for users who are in a file's group to the
permissions that other users have for the file.  Thus, if the file
started out as mode 664 (`rw-rw-r--'), the above mode would change it
to mode 666 (`rw-rw-rw-').  If the file had started out as mode 741
(`rwxr----x'), the above mode would change it to mode 745
(`rwxr--r-x').  The `-' and `=' operations work analogously.

Changing Special Permissions
----------------------------

   In addition to changing a file's read, write, and execute
permissions, you can change its special permissions.  *Note Mode
Structure::, for a summary of these permissions.

   To change a file's permission to set the user ID on execution, use
`u' in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and `s' in the PERMISSIONS
part.

   To change a file's permission to set the group ID on execution, use
`g' in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and `s' in the PERMISSIONS
part.

   To change a file's permission to stay permanently on the swap device,
use `o' in the USERS part of the symbolic mode and `t' in the
PERMISSIONS part.

   For example, to add set user ID permission to a program, you can use
the mode:

     u+s

   To remove both set user ID and set group ID permission from it, you
can use the mode:

     ug-s

   To cause a program to be saved on the swap device, you can use the
mode:

     o+t

   Remember that the special permissions only affect files that are
executable, plus, on some systems, directories (on which they have
different meanings; *note Mode Structure::).  Also, the combinations
`u+t', `g+t', and `o+s' have no effect.

   The `=' operator is not very useful with special permissions; for
example, the mode:

     o=t

does cause the file to be saved on the swap device, but it also removes
all read, write, and execute permissions that users not in the file's
group might have had for it.

Conditional Executability
-------------------------

   There is one more special type of symbolic permission: if you use
`X' instead of `x', execute permission is affected only if the file
already had execute permission or is a directory.  It affects
directories' execute permission even if they did not initially have any
execute permissions set.

   For example, this mode:

     a+X

gives all users permission to execute files (or search directories) if
anyone could before.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Multiple Changes,  Next: Umask and Protection,  Prev: Conditional Executability,  Up: Symbolic Modes

Making Multiple Changes
-----------------------

   The format of symbolic modes is actually more complex than described
above (*note Setting Permissions::).  It provides two ways to make
multiple changes to files' permissions.

   The first way is to specify multiple OPERATION and PERMISSIONS parts
after a USERS part in the symbolic mode.

   For example, the mode:

     og+rX-w

gives users other than the owner of the file read permission and, if it
is a directory or if someone already had execute permission to it,
gives them execute permission; and it also denies them write permission
to the file.  It does not affect the permission that the owner of the
file has for it.  The above mode is equivalent to the two modes:

     og+rX
     og-w

   The second way to make multiple changes is to specify more than one
simple symbolic mode, separated by commas.  For example, the mode:

     a+r,go-w

gives everyone permission to read the file and removes write permission
on it for all users except its owner.  Another example:

     u=rwx,g=rx,o=

sets all of the non-special permissions for the file explicitly.  (It
gives users who are not in the file's group no permission at all for
it.)

   The two methods can be combined.  The mode:

     a+r,g+x-w

gives all users permission to read the file, and gives users who are in
the file's group permission to execute it, as well, but not permission
to write to it.  The above mode could be written in several different
ways; another is:

     u+r,g+rx,o+r,g-w


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Umask and Protection,  Prev: Multiple Changes,  Up: Symbolic Modes

The Umask and Protection
------------------------

   If the USERS part of a symbolic mode is omitted, it defaults to `a'
(affect all users), except that any permissions that are _set_ in the
system variable `umask' are _not affected_.  The value of `umask' can
be set using the `umask' command.  Its default value varies from system
to system.

   Omitting the USERS part of a symbolic mode is generally not useful
with operations other than `+'.  It is useful with `+' because it
allows you to use `umask' as an easily customizable protection against
giving away more permission to files than you intended to.

   As an example, if `umask' has the value 2, which removes write
permission for users who are not in the file's group, then the mode:

     +w

adds permission to write to the file to its owner and to other users who
are in the file's group, but _not_ to other users.  In contrast, the
mode:

     a+w

ignores `umask', and _does_ give write permission for the file to all
users.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Numeric Modes,  Prev: Symbolic Modes,  Up: File permissions

Numeric Modes
=============

   File permissions are stored internally as integers.  As an
alternative to giving a symbolic mode, you can give an octal (base 8)
number that corresponds to the internal representation of the new mode.
This number is always interpreted in octal; you do not have to add a
leading 0, as you do in C.  Mode 0055 is the same as mode 55.

   A numeric mode is usually shorter than the corresponding symbolic
mode, but it is limited in that it cannot take into account a file's
previous permissions; it can only set them absolutely.

   On most systems, the permissions granted to the user, to other users
in the file's group, and to other users not in the file's group are
each stored as three bits, which are represented as one octal digit.
The three special permissions are also each stored as one bit, and they
are as a group represented as another octal digit.  Here is how the
bits are arranged, starting with the lowest valued bit:

     Value in  Corresponding
     Mode      Permission
     
               Other users not in the file's group:
        1      Execute
        2      Write
        4      Read
     
               Other users in the file's group:
       10      Execute
       20      Write
       40      Read
     
               The file's owner:
      100      Execute
      200      Write
      400      Read
     
               Special permissions:
     1000      Save text image on swap device
     2000      Set group ID on execution
     4000      Set user ID on execution

   For example, numeric mode 4755 corresponds to symbolic mode
`u=rwxs,go=rx', and numeric mode 664 corresponds to symbolic mode
`ug=rw,o=r'.  Numeric mode 0 corresponds to symbolic mode `ugo='.

******************

   First, a quote:

     Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months,
     are so complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make
     coherent mental reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had
     some tyrannical god contrived to enslave our minds to time, to
     make it all but impossible for us to escape subjection to sodden
     routines and unpleasant surprises, he could hardly have done
     better than handing down our present system.  It is like a set of
     trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
     surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands
     ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
     circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language
     and science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
     level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
     persistently encourages our terror of time.

     ...  It is as though architects had to measure length in feet,
     width in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction
     manuals demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is
     no wonder then that we often look into our own immediate past or
     future, last Tuesday or a week from Sunday, with feelings of
     helpless confusion.  ...

     -- Robert Grudin, `Time and the Art of Living'.

   This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept.  These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs.  The C interface (via the `getdate'
function) is not described here.

   Although the date syntax here can represent any possible time since
the year zero, computer integers often cannot represent such a wide
range of time.  On POSIX systems, the clock starts at 1970-01-01
00:00:00 UTC: POSIX does not require support for times before the POSIX
Epoch and times far in the future.  Traditional Unix systems have
32-bit signed `time_t' and can represent times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52
through 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.  Systems with 64-bit signed `time_t'
can represent all the times in the known lifetime of the universe.

General date syntax
===================

   A "date" is a string, possibly empty, containing many items
separated by whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no
ambiguity arises.  The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e.,
midnight).  Order of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain
many flavors of items:

   * calendar date items

   * time of the day items

   * time zone items

   * day of the week items

   * relative items

   * pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

   A few numbers may be written out in words in most contexts.  This is
most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items (see
below).  Here is the list: `first' for 1, `next' for 2, `third' for 3,
`fourth' for 4, `fifth' for 5, `sixth' for 6, `seventh' for 7, `eighth'
for 8, `ninth' for 9, `tenth' for 10, `eleventh' for 11 and `twelfth'
for 12.  Also, `last' means exactly -1.

   When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be
written numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes
the allowed strings.

   In the current implementation, only English is supported for words
and abbreviations like `AM', `DST', `EST', `first', `January',
`Sunday', `tomorrow', and `year'.

   The output of `date' is not always acceptable as a date string, not
only because of the language problem, but also because there is no
standard meaning for time zone items like `IST'.  When using `date' to
generate a date string intended to be parsed later, specify a date
format that is independent of language and that does not use time zone
items other than `UTC' and `Z'.  Here are some ways to do this:

     $ LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 date
     Fri Dec 15 19:48:05 UTC 2000
     $ TZ=UTC0 date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%SZ"
     2000-12-15 19:48:05Z
     $ date --iso-8601=seconds  # a GNU extension
     2000-12-15T11:48:05-0800
     $ date --rfc-822  # a GNU extension
     Fri, 15 Dec 2000 11:48:05 -0800
     $ date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"  # %z is a GNU extension.
     2000-12-15 11:48:05 -0800

   Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored.  Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Calendar date items,  Next: Time of day items,  Prev: General date syntax,  Up: Date input formats

Calendar date items
===================

   A "calendar date item" specifies a day of the year.  It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

     1972-09-24     # ISO 8601.
     72-9-24        # Assume 19xx for 69 through 99,
                    # 20xx for 00 through 68.
     72-09-24       # Leading zeros are ignored.
     9/24/72        # Common U.S. writing.
     24 September 1972
     24 Sept 72     # September has a special abbreviation.
     24 Sep 72      # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
     Sep 24, 1972
     24-sep-72
     24sep72

   The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year
is used, or the current year if none.  For example:

     9/24
     sep 24

   Here are the rules.

   For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY' is allowed,
where YEAR is any positive number, MONTH is a number between 01 and 12,
and DAY is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If YEAR is 68 or smaller, then 2000 is
added to it; otherwise, if YEAR is less than 100, then 1900 is added to
it.  The construct `MONTH/DAY/YEAR', popular in the United States, is
accepted.  Also `MONTH/DAY', omitting the year.

   Literal months may be spelled out in full: `January', `February',
`March', `April', `May', `June', `July', `August', `September',
`October', `November' or `December'.  Literal months may be abbreviated
to their first three letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.
It is also permitted to write `Sept' instead of `September'.

   When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as
any of the following:

     DAY MONTH YEAR
     DAY MONTH
     MONTH DAY YEAR
     DAY-MONTH-YEAR

   Or, omitting the year:

     MONTH DAY


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Time of day items,  Next: Time zone items,  Prev: Calendar date items,  Up: Date input formats

Time of day items
=================

   A "time of day item" in date strings specifies the time on a given
day.  Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

     20:02:0
     20:02
     8:02pm
     20:02-0500      # In EST (U.S. Eastern Standard Time).

   More generally, the time of the day may be given as
`HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND', where HOUR is a number between 0 and 23, MINUTE
is a number between 0 and 59, and SECOND is a number between 0 and 59.
Alternatively, `:SECOND' can be omitted, in which case it is taken to
be zero.

   If the time is followed by `am' or `pm' (or `a.m.' or `p.m.'), HOUR
is restricted to run from 1 to 12, and `:MINUTE' may be omitted (taken
to be zero).  `am' indicates the first half of the day, `pm' indicates
the second half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of
1: midnight is `12am' while noon is `12pm'.  (This is the zero-oriented
interpretation of `12am' and `12pm', as opposed to the old tradition
derived from Latin which uses `12m' for noon and `12pm' for midnight.)

   The time may alternatively be followed by a time zone correction,
expressed as `SHHMM', where S is `+' or `-', HH is a number of zone
hours and MM is a number of zone minutes.  When a time zone correction
is given this way, it forces interpretation of the time relative to
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), overriding any previous specification
for the time zone or the local time zone.  The MINUTE part of the time
of the day may not be elided when a time zone correction is used.  This
is the best way to specify a time zone correction by fractional parts
of an hour.

   Either `am'/`pm' or a time zone correction may be specified, but not
both.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Time zone items,  Next: Day of week items,  Prev: Time of day items,  Up: Date input formats

Time zone items
===============

   A "time zone item" specifies an international time zone, indicated
by a small set of letters, e.g., `UTC' or `Z' for Coordinated Universal
Time.  Any included periods are ignored.  By following a
non-daylight-saving time zone by the string `DST' in a separate word
(that is, separated by some white space), the corresponding daylight
saving time zone may be specified.

   Time zone items other than `UTC' and `Z' are obsolescent and are not
recommended, because they are ambiguous; for example, `EST' has a
different meaning in Australia than in the United States.  Instead,
it's better to use unambiguous numeric time zone corrections like
`-0500', as described in the previous section.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Day of week items,  Next: Relative items in date strings,  Prev: Time zone items,  Up: Date input formats

Day of week items
=================

   The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date
(only if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

   Days of the week may be spelled out in full: `Sunday', `Monday',
`Tuesday', `Wednesday', `Thursday', `Friday' or `Saturday'.  Days may
be abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
period.  The special abbreviations `Tues' for `Tuesday', `Wednes' for
`Wednesday' and `Thur' or `Thurs' for `Thursday' are also allowed.

   A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like `third
monday'.  In this context, `last DAY' or `next DAY' is also acceptable;
they move one week before or after the day that DAY by itself would
represent.

   A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Relative items in date strings,  Next: Pure numbers in date strings,  Prev: Day of week items,  Up: Date input formats

Relative items in date strings
==============================

   "Relative items" adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

     1 year
     1 year ago
     3 years
     2 days

   The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string `year'
or `month' for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy units,
as years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise units
are `fortnight' which is worth 14 days, `week' worth 7 days, `day'
worth 24 hours, `hour' worth 60 minutes, `minute' or `min' worth 60
seconds, and `second' or `sec' worth one second.  An `s' suffix on
these units is accepted and ignored.

   The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an
optionally signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively
signed.  No number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a
relative item by the string `ago' is equivalent to preceding the unit
by a multiplier with value -1.

   The string `tomorrow' is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
`day'), the string `yesterday' is worth one day in the past (equivalent
to `day ago').

   The strings `now' or `today' are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise changed by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in `12:00 today'.  The string `this' also has the meaning
of a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings
like `this thursday'.

   When a relative item causes the resulting date to cross a boundary
where the clocks were adjusted, typically for daylight-saving time, the
resulting date and time are adjusted accordingly.

Pure numbers in date strings
============================

   The precise interpretation of a pure decimal number depends on the
context in the date string.

   If the decimal number is of the form YYYYMMDD and no other calendar
date item (*note Calendar date items::) appears before it in the date
string, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as
the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

   If the decimal number is of the form HHMM and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then HH is read as the hour
of the day and MM as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
the day.  MM can also be omitted.

   If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a
number in the date string, but no relative item, then the number
overrides the year.

Authors of `getdate'
====================

   `getdate' was originally implemented by Steven M. Bellovin
(<smb@research.att.com>) while at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.  The code was later tweaked by a couple of people on
Usenet, then completely overhauled by Rich $alz (<rsalz@bbn.com>) and
Jim Berets (<jberets@bbn.com>) in August, 1990.  Various revisions for
the GNU system were made by David MacKenzie, Jim Meyering, Paul Eggert
and others.

   This chapter was originally produced by Franc,ois Pinard
(<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>) from the `getdate.y' source code, and then
edited by K. Berry (<kb@cs.umb.edu>).

Toolbox Introduction
====================

   This month's column is only peripherally related to the GNU Project,
in that it describes a number of the GNU tools on your GNU/Linux system
and how they might be used.  What it's really about is the "Software
Tools" philosophy of program development and usage.

   The software tools philosophy was an important and integral concept
in the initial design and development of Unix (of which Linux and GNU
are essentially clones).  Unfortunately, in the modern day press of
Internetworking and flashy GUIs, it seems to have fallen by the
wayside.  This is a shame, since it provides a powerful mental model
for solving many kinds of problems.

   Many people carry a Swiss Army knife around in their pants pockets
(or purse).  A Swiss Army knife is a handy tool to have: it has several
knife blades, a screwdriver, tweezers, toothpick, nail file, corkscrew,
and perhaps a number of other things on it.  For the everyday, small
miscellaneous jobs where you need a simple, general purpose tool, it's
just the thing.

   On the other hand, an experienced carpenter doesn't build a house
using a Swiss Army knife.  Instead, he has a toolbox chock full of
specialized tools--a saw, a hammer, a screwdriver, a plane, and so on.
And he knows exactly when and where to use each tool; you won't catch
him hammering nails with the handle of his screwdriver.

   The Unix developers at Bell Labs were all professional programmers
and trained computer scientists.  They had found that while a
one-size-fits-all program might appeal to a user because there's only
one program to use, in practice such programs are

  a. difficult to write,

  b. difficult to maintain and debug, and

  c. difficult to extend to meet new situations.

   Instead, they felt that programs should be specialized tools.  In
short, each program "should do one thing well."  No more and no less.
Such programs are simpler to design, write, and get right--they only do
one thing.

   Furthermore, they found that with the right machinery for hooking
programs together, that the whole was greater than the sum of the
parts.  By combining several special purpose programs, you could
accomplish a specific task that none of the programs was designed for,
and accomplish it much more quickly and easily than if you had to write
a special purpose program.  We will see some (classic) examples of this
further on in the column.  (An important additional point was that, if
necessary, take a detour and build any software tools you may need
first, if you don't already have something appropriate in the toolbox.)

I/O Redirection
===============

   Hopefully, you are familiar with the basics of I/O redirection in the
shell, in particular the concepts of "standard input," "standard
output," and "standard error".  Briefly, "standard input" is a data
source, where data comes from.  A program should not need to either
know or care if the data source is a disk file, a keyboard, a magnetic
tape, or even a punched card reader.  Similarly, "standard output" is a
data sink, where data goes to.  The program should neither know nor
care where this might be.  Programs that only read their standard
input, do something to the data, and then send it on, are called
"filters", by analogy to filters in a water pipeline.

   With the Unix shell, it's very easy to set up data pipelines:

     program_to_create_data | filter1 | .... | filterN > final.pretty.data

   We start out by creating the raw data; each filter applies some
successive transformation to the data, until by the time it comes out
of the pipeline, it is in the desired form.

   This is fine and good for standard input and standard output.  Where
does the standard error come in to play?  Well, think about `filter1' in
the pipeline above.  What happens if it encounters an error in the data
it sees?  If it writes an error message to standard output, it will just
disappear down the pipeline into `filter2''s input, and the user will
probably never see it.  So programs need a place where they can send
error messages so that the user will notice them.  This is standard
error, and it is usually connected to your console or window, even if
you have redirected standard output of your program away from your
screen.

   For filter programs to work together, the format of the data has to
be agreed upon.  The most straightforward and easiest format to use is
simply lines of text.  Unix data files are generally just streams of
bytes, with lines delimited by the ASCII LF (Line Feed) character,
conventionally called a "newline" in the Unix literature. (This is
`'\n'' if you're a C programmer.)  This is the format used by all the
traditional filtering programs.  (Many earlier operating systems had
elaborate facilities and special purpose programs for managing binary
data.  Unix has always shied away from such things, under the
philosophy that it's easiest to simply be able to view and edit your
data with a text editor.)

   OK, enough introduction. Let's take a look at some of the tools, and
then we'll see how to hook them together in interesting ways.   In the
following discussion, we will only present those command line options
that interest us.  As you should always do, double check your system
documentation for the full story.

The `who' Command
=================

   The first program is the `who' command.  By itself, it generates a
list of the users who are currently logged in.  Although I'm writing
this on a single-user system, we'll pretend that several people are
logged in:

     $ who
     -| arnold   console Jan 22 19:57
     -| miriam   ttyp0   Jan 23 14:19(:0.0)
     -| bill     ttyp1   Jan 21 09:32(:0.0)
     -| arnold   ttyp2   Jan 23 20:48(:0.0)

   Here, the `$' is the usual shell prompt, at which I typed `who'.
There are three people logged in, and I am logged in twice.  On
traditional Unix systems, user names are never more than eight
characters long.  This little bit of trivia will be useful later.  The
output of `who' is nice, but the data is not all that exciting.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: The cut command,  Next: The sort command,  Prev: The who command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `cut' Command
=================

   The next program we'll look at is the `cut' command.  This program
cuts out columns or fields of input data.  For example, we can tell it
to print just the login name and full name from the `/etc/passwd' file.
The `/etc/passwd' file has seven fields, separated by colons:

     arnold:xyzzy:2076:10:Arnold D. Robbins:/home/arnold:/bin/bash

   To get the first and fifth fields, we would use `cut' like this:

     $ cut -d: -f1,5 /etc/passwd
     -| root:Operator
     ...
     -| arnold:Arnold D. Robbins
     -| miriam:Miriam A. Robbins
     ...

   With the `-c' option, `cut' will cut out specific characters (i.e.,
columns) in the input lines.  This is useful for input data that has
fixed width fields, and does not have a field separator.  For example,
list the Monday dates for the current month:

     $ cal | cut -c 3-5
     -|Mo
     -|
     -|  6
     -| 13
     -| 20
     -| 27

   Cut can also add field separators to fixed width data, using the
`--output-delimiter' option.  This can be very useful to fill a
database:

     $ ls -ld ~/* | cut --output-delimiter=, -c1,2-4,5-7,8-10,57- | tee home.cs
     -| d,rwx,r-x,r-x,CVS
     -| d,rwx,---,---,Mail
     -| d,rwx,r-x,r-x,lilypond
     -| d,rwx,r-x,r-x,savannah
     $ mysql -e 'create table home \
       (d char(1),u char(3), g char (3), o char (3), name text)' test
     $ mysqlimport --fields-terminated-by=, test home.cs
     -| test.home: Records: 4  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
     $ mysql -e 'select * from home' test
     -| +------+------+------+------+----------+
     -| | d    | u    | g    | o    | name     |
     -| +------+------+------+------+----------+
     -| | d    | rwx  | r-x  | r-x  | CVS      |
     -| | d    | rwx  | ---  | ---  | Mail     |
     -| | d    | rwx  | r-x  | r-x  | lilypond |
     -| | d    | rwx  | r-x  | r-x  | savannah |
     -| +------+------+------+------+----------+

   But beware of assumptions.  The above invocation of `ls' assumes
that the owner and group names are no longer than eight bytes each, and
that no file has size larger than 99999999 bytes.  Otherwise, the byte
offset of `57' would need to be larger.  To avoid such problems,
suppress output of the owner and group names with the `-g' and `-G'
options respectively, and add the `-h' option to ensure that the
representation of the size of the file does not exceed the allotted
space.  Finally, note that the width of even the date/time field may
change, depending on the current locale.  To avoid that, use an option
like `--time-style='+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S''.

   And there's still another problem: if a file has more than 999 hard
links to it, then that will change the alignment.  The morale is that
it is hard to use fixed byte offsets into a line of `ls' output.  Use a
different tool, like find, but with `-printf' and carefully chosen
format strings.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: The sort command,  Next: The uniq command,  Prev: The cut command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `sort' Command
==================

   Next we'll look at the `sort' command.  This is one of the most
powerful commands on a Unix-style system; one that you will often find
yourself using when setting up fancy data plumbing.

   The `sort' command reads and sorts each file named on the command
line.  It then merges the sorted data and writes it to standard output.
It will read standard input if no files are given on the command line
(thus making it into a filter).  The sort is based on the character
collating sequence or based on user-supplied ordering criteria.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: The uniq command,  Next: Putting the tools together,  Prev: The sort command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `uniq' Command
==================

   Finally (at least for now), we'll look at the `uniq' program.  When
sorting data, you will often end up with duplicate lines, lines that
are identical.  Usually, all you need is one instance of each line.
This is where `uniq' comes in. The `uniq' program reads its standard
input, which it expects to be sorted.  It only prints out one copy of
each duplicated line.  It does have several options.  Later on, we'll
use the `-c' option, which prints each unique line, preceded by a count
of the number of times that line occurred in the input.


File: coreutils.info,  Node: Putting the tools together,  Prev: The uniq command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

Putting the Tools Together
==========================

   Now, let's suppose this is a large ISP server system with dozens of
users logged in.  The management wants the system administrator to
write a program that will generate a sorted list of logged in users.
Furthermore, even if a user is logged in multiple times, his or her
name should only show up in the output once.

   The administrator could sit down with the system documentation and
write a C program that did this. It would take perhaps a couple of
hundred lines of code and about two hours to write it, test it, and
debug it.  However, knowing the software toolbox, the administrator can
instead start out by generating just a list of logged on users:

     $ who | cut -c1-8
     -| arnold
     -| miriam
     -| bill
     -| arnold

   Next, sort the list:

     $ who | cut -c1-8 | sort
     -| arnold
     -| arnold
     -| bill
     -| miriam

   Finally, run the sorted list through `uniq', to weed out duplicates:

     $ who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
     -| arnold
     -| bill
     -| miriam

   The `sort' command actually has a `-u' option that does what `uniq'
does. However, `uniq' has other uses for which one cannot substitute
`sort -u'.

   The administrator puts this pipeline into a shell script, and makes
it available for all the users on the system (`#' is the system
administrator, or `root', prompt):

     # cat > /usr/local/bin/listusers
     who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
     ^D
     # chmod +x /usr/local/bin/listusers

   There are four major points to note here.  First, with just four
programs, on one command line, the administrator was able to save about
two hours worth of work.  Furthermore, the shell pipeline is just about
as efficient as the C program would be, and it is much more efficient in
terms of programmer time.  People time is much more expensive than
computer time, and in our modern "there's never enough time to do
everything" society, saving two hours of programmer time is no mean
feat.

   Second, it is also important to emphasize that with the
_combination_ of the tools, it is possible to do a special purpose job
never imagined by the authors of the individual programs.

   Third, it is also valuable to build up your pipeline in stages, as
we did here.  This allows you to view the data at each stage in the
pipeline, which helps you acquire the confidence that you are indeed
using these tools correctly.

   Finally, by bundling the pipeline in a shell script, other users can
use your command, without having to remember the fancy plumbing you set
up for them. In terms of how you run them, shell scripts and compiled
programs are indistinguishable.

   After the previous warm-up exercise, we'll look at two additional,
more complicated pipelines.  For them, we need to introduce two more
tools.

   The first is the `tr' command, which stands for "transliterate."
The `tr' command works on a character-by-character basis, changing
characters. Normally it is used for things like mapping upper case to
lower case:

     $ echo ThIs ExAmPlE HaS MIXED case! | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'
     -| this example has mixed case!

   There are several options of interest:

`-c'
     work on the complement of the listed characters, i.e., operations
     apply to characters not in the given set

`-d'
     delete characters in the first set from the output

`-s'
     squeeze repeated characters in the output into just one character.

   We will be using all three options in a moment.

   The other command we'll look at is `comm'.  The `comm' command takes
two sorted input files as input data, and prints out the files' lines
in three columns.  The output columns are the data lines unique to the
first file, the data lines unique to the second file, and the data
lines that are common to both.  The `-1', `-2', and `-3' command line
options _omit_ the respective columns. (This is non-intuitive and takes
a little getting used to.)  For example:

     $ cat f1
     -| 11111
     -| 22222
     -| 33333
     -| 44444
     $ cat f2
     -| 00000
     -| 22222
     -| 33333
     -| 55555
     $ comm f1 f2
     -|         00000
     -| 11111
     -|                 22222
     -|                 33333
     -| 44444
     -|         55555

   The single dash as a filename tells `comm' to read standard input
instead of a regular file.

   Now we're ready to build a fancy pipeline.  The first application is
a word frequency counter.  This helps an author determine if he or she
is over-using certain words.

   The first step is to change the case of all the letters in our input
file to one case.  "The" and "the" are the same word when doing
counting.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | ...

   The next step is to get rid of punctuation.  Quoted words and
unquoted words should be treated identically; it's easiest to just get
the punctuation out of the way.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' | ...

   The second `tr' command operates on the complement of the listed
characters, which are all the letters, the digits, the underscore, and
the blank.  The `\012' represents the newline character; it has to be
left alone.  (The ASCII tab character should also be included for good
measure in a production script.)

   At this point, we have data consisting of words separated by blank
space.  The words only contain alphanumeric characters (and the
underscore).  The next step is break the data apart so that we have one
word per line. This makes the counting operation much easier, as we
will see shortly.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | ...

   This command turns blanks into newlines.  The `-s' option squeezes
multiple newline characters in the output into just one.  This helps us
avoid blank lines. (The `>' is the shell's "secondary prompt."  This is
what the shell prints when it notices you haven't finished typing in
all of a command.)

   We now have data consisting of one word per line, no punctuation,
all one case.  We're ready to count each word:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort | uniq -c | ...

   At this point, the data might look something like this:

       60 a
        2 able
        6 about
        1 above
        2 accomplish
        1 acquire
        1 actually
        2 additional

   The output is sorted by word, not by count!  What we want is the most
frequently used words first.  Fortunately, this is easy to accomplish,
with the help of two more `sort' options:

`-n'
     do a numeric sort, not a textual one

`-r'
     reverse the order of the sort

   The final pipeline looks like this:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
     -|  156 the
     -|   60 a
     -|   58 to
     -|   51 of
     -|   51 and
     ...

   Whew!  That's a lot to digest.  Yet, the same principles apply. With
six commands, on two lines (really one long one split for convenience),
we've created a program that does something interesting and useful, in
much less time than we could have written a C program to do the same
thing.

   A minor modification to the above pipeline can give us a simple
spelling checker!  To determine if you've spelled a word correctly, all
you have to do is look it up in a dictionary.  If it is not there, then
chances are that your spelling is incorrect.  So, we need a dictionary.
The conventional location for a dictionary is `/usr/dict/words'.  On my
GNU/Linux system,(1) this is a is a sorted, 45,402 word dictionary.

   Now, how to compare our file with the dictionary?  As before, we
generate a sorted list of words, one per line:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort -u | ...

   Now, all we need is a list of words that are _not_ in the
dictionary.  Here is where the `comm' command comes in.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort -u |
     > comm -23 - /usr/dict/words

   The `-2' and `-3' options eliminate lines that are only in the
dictionary (the second file), and lines that are in both files.  Lines
only in the first file (standard input, our stream of words), are words
that are not in the dictionary.  These are likely candidates for
spelling errors.  This pipeline was the first cut at a production
spelling checker on Unix.

   There are some other tools that deserve brief mention.

`grep'
     search files for text that matches a regular expression

`wc'
     count lines, words, characters

`tee'
     a T-fitting for data pipes, copies data to files and to standard
     output

`sed'
     the stream editor, an advanced tool

`awk'
     a data manipulation language, another advanced tool

   The software tools philosophy also espoused the following bit of
advice: "Let someone else do the hard part."  This means, take
something that gives you most of what you need, and then massage it the
rest of the way until it's in the form that you want.

   To summarize:

  1. Each program should do one thing well.  No more, no less.

  2. Combining programs with appropriate plumbing leads to results where
     the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  It also leads to
     novel uses of programs that the authors might never have imagined.

  3. Programs should never print extraneous header or trailer data,
     since these could get sent on down a pipeline. (A point we didn't
     mention earlier.)

  4. Let someone else do the hard part.

  5. Know your toolbox!  Use each program appropriately. If you don't
     have an appropriate tool, build one.

   As of this writing, all the programs we've discussed are available
via anonymous `ftp' from:
`ftp://gnudist.gnu.org/textutils/textutils-1.22.tar.gz'.  (There may be
more recent versions available now.)

   None of what I have presented in this column is new. The Software
Tools philosophy was first introduced in the book `Software Tools', by
Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-03669-X).
This book showed how to write and use software tools.  It was written in
1976, using a preprocessor for FORTRAN named `ratfor' (RATional
FORtran).  At the time, C was not as ubiquitous as it is now; FORTRAN
was.  The last chapter presented a `ratfor' to FORTRAN processor,
written in `ratfor'. `ratfor' looks an awful lot like C; if you know C,
you won't have any problem following the code.

   In 1981, the book was updated and made available as `Software Tools
in Pascal' (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10342-7).  The first book is
still in print; the second, alas, is not.  Both books are well worth
reading if you're a programmer.  They certainly made a major change in
how I view programming.

   Initially, the programs in both books were available (on 9-track
tape) from Addison-Wesley.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case,
although the `ratfor' versions are available from Brian Kernighan's
home page (http://cm.bell-labs.come/who/bwk), and you might be able to
find copies of the Pascal versions floating around the Internet.  For a
number of years, there was an active Software Tools Users Group, whose
members had ported the original `ratfor' programs to essentially every
computer system with a FORTRAN compiler.  The popularity of the group
waned in the middle 1980s as Unix began to spread beyond universities.

   With the current proliferation of GNU code and other clones of Unix
programs, these programs now receive little attention; modern C
versions are much more efficient and do more than these programs do.
Nevertheless, as exposition of good programming style, and evangelism
for a still-valuable philosophy, these books are unparalleled, and I
recommend them highly.

   Acknowledgment: I would like to express my gratitude to Brian
Kernighan of Bell Labs, the original Software Toolsmith, for reviewing
this column.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:


       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover
Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
