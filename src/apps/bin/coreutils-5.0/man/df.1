.SH NAME
df \- report filesystem disk space usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B df
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR df .
.B df
displays the amount of disk space available on the filesystem
containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the
space available on all currently mounted filesystems is shown.  Disk
space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are
used.
.PP
If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a
mounted filesystem,
.B df
shows the space available on that filesystem rather than on the
filesystem containing the device node (which is always the root
filesystem).  This version of
.B df
cannot show the space available on unmounted filesystems, because on
most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate
knowledge of filesystem structures.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Show information about the filesystem on which each FILE resides,
or all filesystems by default.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
include filesystems having 0 blocks
.HP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-block\-size\fR=\fISIZE\fR use SIZE-byte blocks
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-human\-readable\fR
print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-si\fR
likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inodes\fR
list inode information instead of block usage
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
like \fB\-\-block\-size\fR=\fI1K\fR
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR
limit listing to local filesystems
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sync\fR
do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-portability\fR
use the POSIX output format
.TP
\fB\-\-sync\fR
invoke sync before getting usage info
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
limit listing to filesystems of type TYPE
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-print\-type\fR
print filesystem type
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\-type\fR=\fITYPE\fR
limit listing to filesystems not of type TYPE
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
(ignored)
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one of following:
kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M 1,048,576, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
