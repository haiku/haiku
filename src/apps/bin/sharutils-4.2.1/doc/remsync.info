   `remsync' allows for remote synchronization of directory trees,
using electronic mail.

   The current `remsync' release is 1.3.  This is an alpha state
product, and this documentation is still sketchy.

Overview of `remsync' and friends
*********************************

   The `remsync' program allows for transmitting, over email, selected
parts of directories for trying to maintain up-to-date files over many
sites.  It sends out and processes incoming specially packaged files
using `shar', `tar', `gzip' and electronic mail programs.

   There is no *master* site, each site has an equal opportunity to
modify files, and modified files are propagated.  Among many other
commands, the `broadcast' command sends an update package from the
current site to all others, the `process' command is used to apply
update packages locally after reception from remote sites.

   The unit of transmission is whole files.  For now, whenever a module
is modified, it is silently synchronized only if it has been modified at
only one place.  The merging has to be done at the site where the
discrepancy is observed, from where it is propagated again.

How `remsync' works
===================

   How does `remsync' keep track of what is in sync, and what isn't?
*Note Xremsync::, for a the documentation on the `.remsync' file
format.  I understand that a mere description of the format does not
replace an explanation, but in the meantime, you might guess from the
format how the program works.

   All files are summarized by a checksum, computed by the `sum'
program.  There are a few variants of `sum' computing checksums in
incompatible ways, under the control of options.  `remsync' attempts to
retrieve on each site a compatible way to do it, and complains if it
cannot.

   `remsync' does not compare dates or sizes.  Experience shown that the
best version of a file is not necessarily the one with the latest
timestamp.  The best version for a site is the current version on this
site, as decided by its maintainer there, and this is this version that
will be propagated.

   Each site has an idea of the checksum of a file for all other sites.
These checksums are not necessarily identical, for sites do not
necessarily propagate to all others, and the propagation network maybe
incomplete or asymmetrical in various ways.

   Propagation is never done unattended.  The user on a site has to call
`remsync broadcast' to issue synchronization packages for other sites.
If this is never done, the local modifications will never leave the
site.  The user also has to call `remsync process' to apply received
synchronization packages.  Applying a package does not automatically
broadcast it further (maybe this could change?).

   If a site A propagates some files to sites B and D, but not C, site
B is informed that site D also received these files, and site D is
informed that site B also received these files, so they will not
propagate again the same files to one another.  However, both site B
and D are susceptible to propagate further the same files to site C.

   It may happen that a site refuses to update a file, or modifies a
file after having been received, or merges versions, or whatever.  So,
sites may have a wrong opinion of the file contents on other sites.
These differences level down after a few exchanges, and it is very
unlikely that a file would not be propagated when it should have.

   This scheme works only when the various people handling the various
files have confidence in one each other.  If site B modifies a file
after having received it from site A, the file will eventually be
propagated back to site A.  If the original file stayed undisturbed on
site A, that is, if `remsync' proves that site B correctly knew the
checksum of the original file, then the file will be replaced on site A
without any user confirmation.  So, the user on site A has to trust the
changes made by the user on site B.

   If the original file on site A had been modified after having been
sent in a synchronization package, than it is the responsibility of the
user on site A to correctly merge the local modifications with the
modifications observed in the file as received from site B.  This
responsibility is real, since the merged file will later be propagated
to the other sites in an authoritative way.

File: remsync.info,  Node: Invoking remsync,  Next: Conveniences,  Prev: Remsync,  Up: Remsync

The `remsync' command and arguments
===================================

   At the shell prompt, calling the command `remsync' without any
parameters initiates an interactive dialog, in which the user types
commands and receives feedback from the program.

   The command `remsync', given at the shell prompt, may have
arguments, in which case these arguments taken together form one
`remsync' interactive command.  However, `--help' and `--version'
options are interpreted especially, with their usual effect in GNU.
Once this command has been executed, no more commands are taken from
the user and `remsync' terminates execution.  This allows for using
`remsync' in some kind of batch mode.  It is unwise to redirect
`remsync' standard input, because user interactions might often be
needed in ways difficult to predict in advance.

   The two most common usages of `remsync' are the commands:

     remsync b
     remsync p

   The first example executes the `broadcast' command, which sends
synchronization packages to all connected remote sites for the current
local directory tree.

   The second example executes the `process' command, which studies and
complies with a synchronisation package saved in the current directory
(not necessarily into the synchronized directory tree), under the usual
file name `remsync.tar.gz'.

File: remsync.info,  Node: Conveniences,  Next: Commands,  Prev: Invoking remsync,  Up: Remsync

Automatic mechanisms in the `remsync' program
=============================================

   The following points apply to many of the `remsync' commands.  We
describe them here once and for all.

   * The file `.remsync' describes the various properties for the
     current synchronization.  It is kept right in the top directory of
     a synchronized directory tree.  Some commands may be executed
     without any need for this file.  The program waits as far as
     possible before reading it.

   * If the `.remsync' file is not found when required, and only then,
     the user is interactively asked to fill a questionnaire about it.

   * If the `.remsync' file has been logically modified after having
     been read, or if it just has been created, the program will save
     it back on disk.  But it will do so only before reading another
     `.remsync' file, or just before exit.  A preexisting `.remsync'
     will be renamed to `.remsync.bak' before it is rewritten, when
     this is done, any previous `.remsync.bak' file is discarded.

   * Many commands refer to previously entered information by repeating
     this information.  For example, one can refer to a particular
     `scan' statement by entering the wildcard to be scanned by this
     statement.  An alternative method of specifying a statement
     consists in using the decimal number which appears between square
     brackets in the result of a `list' command.

   * Whenever a site list must be given, it is a space separated list of
     remote sites.  If the list is preceeded by a bang (!), the list is
     complemented, that is, the sites that will be operated upon are all
     those *not* appearing in the list.  As a special case, if the site
     list is completely empty, then all sites are selected.


File: remsync.info,  Node: Commands,  Prev: Conveniences,  Up: Remsync

Commands for `remsync'
======================

   Program commands to `remsync' may be given interactively by the user
sitten at a terminal.  They can come from the arguments of the
`remsync' call at the shell level.  Internally, the `process' command
might obey many sub-commands found in a received synchronization
package.

   Program commands are given one per line.  Lines beginning with a
sharp (#) and white lines are ignored, they are meant to increase
clarity or to introduce user comments.  With only a few exceptions,
commands are introduced by a keyword and often contains other keywords.
In all cases, the keywords specific to `remsync' may be abbreviated to
their first letter.  When there are many keywords in succession, the
space separating them may be omitted.  So the following commands are
all equivalent:

     list remote
     l remote
     list r
     l r
     listremote
     lr

while the following are not legal:

     l rem
     lisremote

   Below, for clarity, keywords are written in full and separated by
spaces.  Commands often accept parameters, which are then separated by
spaces.  All available commands are given in the table.  The first few
commands do not pre-require the file `.remsync'.  The last three
commands are almost never used interactively, but rather automatically
triggered while `process''ing received synchronization packages.

`?'
     Display a quick help summary of available commands.

`!' [ SHELL-COMMAND ]
     If SHELL-COMMAND has been given, execute it right now as a shell
     command.  When not given, rather start an interactive shell.
     Exiting from the shell will return to this program.  The started
     shell is taken from the `SHELL' environment variable if set, else
     `sh' is used.

`quit'
     Leave the program normally and return to the shell.

`abort'
     Leave the program with a nonzero exit status and return to the
     shell.  No attempt is made to save a logically modified `.remsync'
     file.

`visit' DIRECTORY
     Select another synchronized directory tree for any subsequent
     operation.  DIRECTORY is the top directory of the synchronized
     directory tree.

`process' [ FILE ]
`list' [ TYPE ]
     List all known statements about some information TYPE.  Allowable
     keywords for TYPE are `local', `remote', `scan', `ignore' and
     `files'.  The keyword `files' asks for all empty statements (see
     later).  If TYPE is omitted, then list all known statements for
     all types, except those given by `files'.

[ `create' ] TYPE VALUE
     Create a new statement introducing a VALUE for a given TYPE.
     Allowable keywords for TYPE are `remote', `scan' and `ignore'.
     The `create' keyword may be omitted.

     For `create' `ignore', when the pattern is preceeded by a bang
     (!), the condition is reversed.  That is, only those files which
     do match the pattern will be kept for synchronization.

`delete' TYPE VALUE
     Delete an existing statement supporting some VALUE for a given
     TYPE.  Allowable keywords for TYPE are `remote', `scan' and
     `ignore'.

`email' REMOTE VALUE
     Modify the electronic mail address associated with some REMOTE
     site, giving it a new VALUE.  The special `local' keyword for
     REMOTE may be used to modify the local electronic mail address.

`home' REMOTE VALUE
     Modify the top directory of the synchronized directory tree
     associated with some REMOTE site, giving it a new VALUE.  The
     special `local' keyword for REMOTE may be used to modify the local
     top directory.

`broadcast' SITE_LIST
     Send by electronic mail an update package to all sites from
     SITE_LIST, containing for each site all and only those files which
     are known to be different between the remote site and here.

`version' VERSION
     This command is not meant for interactive use.  It establishes the
     `remsync' version needed to process the incoming commands.

`from' SITE_LIST
     This command is not really meant for interactive use.  The first
     site from the SITE_LIST is the remote site which originated the
     synchronization package.  All the others are all the sites,
     including here, which were meant to be synchronized by the
     `broadcast' command that was issued at the originating remote site.

`sum' FILE CHECKSUM
     This command is not really meant for interactive use.  It declares
     the CHECKSUM value of a particular FILE at the originating remote
     site.  Also, if at least one `sum' command is received, then it is
     guaranteed that the originating remote site sent one `sum' command
     for each and every file to be synchronized, so any found local
     file which was not subject of any `sum' command does not exist
     remotely.

`if' FILE CHECKSUM PACKAGED
     This command is not really meant for interactive use.  It directs
     the `remsync' program to check if a local FILE has a given
     CHECKSUM.  If the checksum agrees, then the local file will be
     replaced by the PACKAGED file, as found in the received
     synchronization invoice.

Format of the `.remsync' file
=============================

   The `.remsync' file saves all the information a site needs for
properly synchronizing a directory tree with remote sites.  Even if it
is meant to be editable using any ASCII editor, it has a very precise
format and one should be very careful while modifying it.  The
`.remsync' file is better handled through the `remsync' program and
commands.

   The `.remsync' file is made up of statements, one per line.  Each
line begins with a statement keyword followed by a single TAB, then by
one or more parameters.  The keyword may be omitted, in this case, the
keyword is said to be *empty*, and the line begins immediately with the
TAB.  After the TAB, if there are two parameters or more, they should
all be separated with a single space.  There should not be any space
between the last parameter and the end of line (unless there are
explicit empty parameters).

   The following table gives the possible keywords.  Their order of
presentation in the table is also the order of appearance in the
`.remsync' file.

`remsync'
     This statement identifies the `.remsync' format.  The only
     parameter states the file format version.

`local'
     This statement should appear exactly once, and has exactly two
     parameters.  The first parameter gives the electronic mail address
     the other sites should use for sending synchronization packages
     here.  The second parameter gives the name of the local directory
     tree to synchronize, in absolute notation.

`remote'
     This statement may appear zero, one or more times.  Each occurrence
     connects the synchronized directory tree to another tree on a
     remote site.  The first parameter gives one electronic mail
     address where to send remote synchronization packages.  The second
     parameter gives the name of the corresponding directory tree for
     this remote electronic mail address, in absolute notation.

`scan'
     This statement may appear zero, one or more times.  When it does
     not appear at all, the whole local directory tree will always be
     scanned, searching for files to synchronize.  When the statement
     appears at least once, the whole local directory tree will not be
     scanned, but only those files or directories appearing in one of
     these statements.  Each `scan' statement has exactly one
     parameter, giving one file or directory to be studied.  These are
     usually given relative to top directory of the local
     synchronization directory tree.  Shell wildcards are acceptable.

`ignore'
     This statement may appear zero, one or more times.  Each
     occurrence has one parameter giving a regular expression,
     according to Perl syntax for regular expressions.  These REGEXPs
     are applied against each file resulting from the scan.  If any of
     the `ignore' expression matches one of resulting file, the file is
     discarded and is not subject to remote synchronization.

   After all the statements beginning by the previous keywords, the
`.remsync' file usually contains many statements having the empty
keyword.  The empty keyword statement may appear zero, one or more
times.  Each occurrence list one file being remotely synchronized.  The
first parameter gives an explicit file name, usually given relative to
the top directory of the local synchronized directory tree.  Shell
wildcards are *not* acceptable.

   Besides the file name parameter, there are supplementary parameters
to each empty keyword statement, each corresponding to one remote
statement in the `.remsync' file.  The second parameter corresponds to
the first remote, the third parameter corresponds to the second remote,
etc.  If there are more remote statements than supplementary parameters,
missing parameters are considered to be empty.

   Each supplementary parameter usually gives the last known checksum
value for this particular file, as computed on its corresponding
*remote* site.  The parameter contains a dash `-' while the remote
checksum is unknown.  The checksum value for the *local* copy of the
file is never kept anywhere in the `.remsync' file.  The special value
`666' indicates a checksum from hell, used when the remote file is
known to exist, but for which contradictory information has been
received from various sources.

Using News distribution instead?
================================

   One correspondent thinks that perhaps the news distribution mechanism
could be pressed into service for this job.  I could have started from
C-news, say, instead of from scratch, and have progressively bent
C-news to behave like I wanted.

   My feeling is that the route was shorter as I did it, from scratch,
that it would have been from C-news.  Of course, I could have removed
the heavy administrative details of C-news: the history and `expire',
the daemons, the `cron' entries, etc., then added the interactive
features and specialized behaviors, but all this clean up would
certainly have took energies.  Right now, non counting the subsidiary
scripts and shar/unshar sources, the heart of the result is a single
(1200 lines) script written in Perl, which I find fairly more smaller
and maintainable than a patched C-news distribution would have been.

mailsync
--------

     Usage: mailsync [ OPTION ] ... [ EMAIL_ADDRESS ] [ DIRECTORY ]
        or: mailsync [ OPTION ] ... SYNC_DIRECTORY

   Option -i simply sends a `ihave' package, with no bulk files.
Option -n inhibits any destructive operation and mailing.

   In the first form of the call, find a synchronisation directory in
DIRECTORY aimed towards some EMAIL_ADDRESS, then proceed with this
synchronisation directory.  EMAIL_ADDRESS may be the name of a file
containing a distribution list.  If EMAIL_ADDRESS is not specified, all
the synchronisation directories at the top level in DIRECTORY are
processed in turn.  If DIRECTORY is not specified, the current
directory is used.

   In the second form of the call, proceed only with the given
synchronisation directory SYNC_DIRECTORY.

   For proceeding with a synchronisation directory, whatever the form of
the call was, this script reads the `ident' files it contains to set
the local user and directory and the remote user and directory.  Then,
selected files under the local directory which are modified in regard
to the corresponding files in the remote directory are turned into a
synchronisation package which is mailed to the remote user.

   The list of selected files or directories to synchronize from the
local directory are given in the `list' file in the synchronisation
directory.  If this `list' file is missing, all files under the local
directory are synchronized.

   What I usually do is to `cd' at the top of the directory tree to be
synchronized, then to type `mailsync' without parameters.  This will
automatically prepare as many synchronisation packages as there are
mirror systems, then email multipart shars to each of them.  Note that
the synchronisation package is not identical for each mirror system,
because they do not usually have the same state of synchronisation.

   `mailsync' will refuse to work if anything needs to be hand cleaned
from a previous execution of `mailsync' or `resync'.  Check for some
remaining `_syncbulk' or `_synctemp' directory, or for a `_syncrm'
script.

     TODO:
     - interrogate the user if `ident' file missing.
     - automatically construct the local user address.
     - create the synchronisation directory on the fly.
     - avoid duplicating work as far as possible for multiple sends.
     - have a quicker mode, depending on stamps, not on checksums.
     - never send core, executables, backups, `.nsf*', `*/_synctemp/*', etc.

resync
------

     Usage: resync [ OPTION ]... TAR_FILE
        or: resync [ OPTION ]... UNTARED_DIRECTORY

   Given a tar file produced by mailsync at some remote end and already
reconstructed on this end using unshar, or a directory containing the
already untared invoice, apply the synchronization package locally.

   Option -n inhibits destroying or creating files, but does everything
else.  It will in particular create a synchronization directory if
necessary, produce the `_syncbulk' directory and the `_syncrm' script.

   The synchronization directory for the package is automatically
retrieved or, if not found, created and initialized.  `resync' keeps
telling you what it is doing.

   There are a few cases when a resync should not complete without
manual intervention.  The common case is that several sites update the
very same files differently since they were last resync'ed, and then
mailsync to each other.  The prerequisite checksum will then fail, and
the files are then kept into the `_syncbulk' tree, which has a shape
similar to the directory tree in which the files where supposed to go.
For GNU Emacs users, a very handy package, called emerge, written by
Dale Worley <drw@kutta.mit.edu>, helps reconciling two files
interactiveley.  The `_syncbulk' tree should be explicitely deleted
after the hand synchronisation.

   Another case of human intervention is when files are deleted at the
mailsync'ing site.  By choice, all deletions on the receiving side are
accumulated in a `_syncrm' script, which is not executed automatically.
Explicitely executed, `_syncrm' will remove any file in the receiving
tree which does not exist anymore on the sender system.  I often edit
`_syncrm' before executing it, to remove the unwanted deletions (beware
the double negation :-).  The script removes itself.

   All the temporary files, while resynchronizing, are held in
`_synctemp', which is deleted afterwards; if something goes wrong, this
directory should also be cleaned out by hand.  `resync' will refuse to
work if anything remains to be hand cleaned.

     TODO:
     - interrogates the user if missing receiving directory in `ident'.
     - allow `remote.sum' to be empty or non-existent.
