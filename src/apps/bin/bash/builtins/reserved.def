$BUILTIN for
$SHORT_DOC for NAME [in WORDS ... ;] do COMMANDS; done
The `for' loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a
list of items.  If `in WORDS ...;' is not present, then `in "$@"' is
assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is set to that element, and
the COMMANDS are executed.
$END

$BUILTIN for ((
$DOCNAME arith_for
$SHORT_DOC for (( exp1; exp2; exp3 )); do COMMANDS; done
Equivalent to
	(( EXP1 ))
	while (( EXP2 )); do
		COMMANDS
		(( EXP3 ))
	done
EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 are arithmetic expressions.  If any expression is
omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.
$END

$BUILTIN select
$SHORT_DOC select NAME [in WORDS ... ;] do COMMANDS; done
The WORDS are expanded, generating a list of words.  The
set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each
preceded by a number.  If `in WORDS' is not present, `in "$@"'
is assumed.  The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a line read
from the standard input.  If the line consists of the number
corresponding to one of the displayed words, then NAME is set
to that word.  If the line is empty, WORDS and the prompt are
redisplayed.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any other
value read causes NAME to be set to null.  The line read is saved
in the variable REPLY.  COMMANDS are executed after each selection
until a break command is executed.
$END

$BUILTIN time
$SHORT_DOC time [-p] PIPELINE
Execute PIPELINE and print a summary of the real time, user CPU time,
and system CPU time spent executing PIPELINE when it terminates.
The return status is the return status of PIPELINE.  The `-p' option
prints the timing summary in a slightly different format.  This uses
the value of the TIMEFORMAT variable as the output format.
$END

$BUILTIN case
$SHORT_DOC case WORD in [PATTERN [| PATTERN]...) COMMANDS ;;]... esac
Selectively execute COMMANDS based upon WORD matching PATTERN.  The
`|' is used to separate multiple patterns.
$END

$BUILTIN if
$SHORT_DOC if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; ]... [ else COMMANDS; ] fi
The if COMMANDS are executed.  If the exit status is zero, then the then
COMMANDS are executed.  Otherwise, each of the elif COMMANDS are executed
in turn, and if the exit status is zero, the corresponding then COMMANDS
are executed and the if command completes.  Otherwise, the else COMMANDS
are executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the last
command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.
$END

$BUILTIN while
$SHORT_DOC while COMMANDS; do COMMANDS; done
Expand and execute COMMANDS as long as the final command in the
`while' COMMANDS has an exit status of zero.
$END

$BUILTIN until
$SHORT_DOC until COMMANDS; do COMMANDS; done
Expand and execute COMMANDS as long as the final command in the
`until' COMMANDS has an exit status which is not zero.
$END

$BUILTIN function
$SHORT_DOC function NAME { COMMANDS ; } or NAME () { COMMANDS ; }
Create a simple command invoked by NAME which runs COMMANDS.
Arguments on the command line along with NAME are passed to the
function as $0 .. $n.
$END

$BUILTIN { ... }
$DOCNAME grouping_braces
$SHORT_DOC { COMMANDS ; }
Run a set of commands in a group.  This is one way to redirect an
entire set of commands.
$END

$BUILTIN %
$DOCNAME fg_percent
$SHORT_DOC %[DIGITS | WORD] [&]
This is similar to the `fg' command.  Resume a stopped or background
job.  If you specifiy DIGITS, then that job is used.  If you specify
WORD, then the job whose name begins with WORD is used.  Following the
job specification with a `&' places the job in the background.
$END

$BUILTIN (( ... ))
$DOCNAME arith
$SHORT_DOC (( expression ))
The EXPRESSION is evaluated according to the rules for arithmetic
evaluation.  Equivalent to "let EXPRESSION".
$END

$BUILTIN [[ ... ]]
$DOCNAME conditional
$SHORT_DOC [[ expression ]]
Returns a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional
expression EXPRESSION.  Expressions are composed of the same primaries used
by the `test' builtin, and may be combined using the following operators

	( EXPRESSION )	Returns the value of EXPRESSION
	! EXPRESSION	True if EXPRESSION is false; else false
	EXPR1 && EXPR2	True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true; else false
	EXPR1 || EXPR2	True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true; else false

When the `==' and `!=' operators are used, the string to the right of the
operator is used as a pattern and pattern matching is performed.  The
&& and || operators do not evaluate EXPR2 if EXPR1 is sufficient to
determine the expression's value.
$END

$BUILTIN variables
$DOCNAME variable_help
$SHORT_DOC variables - Some variable names and meanings
BASH_VERSION    Version information for this Bash.
CDPATH          A colon separated list of directories to search
		when the argument to `cd' is not found in the current
		directory.
GLOBIGNORE	A colon-separated list of patterns describing filenames to
		be ignored by pathname expansion.
#if defined (HISTORY)
HISTFILE        The name of the file where your command history is stored.
HISTFILESIZE    The maximum number of lines this file can contain.
HISTSIZE        The maximum number of history lines that a running
		shell can access.
#endif /* HISTORY */
HOME            The complete pathname to your login directory.
HOSTNAME	The name of the current host.
HOSTTYPE        The type of CPU this version of Bash is running under.
IGNOREEOF       Controls the action of the shell on receipt of an EOF
		character as the sole input.  If set, then the value
		of it is the number of EOF characters that can be seen
		in a row on an empty line before the shell will exit
		(default 10).  When unset, EOF signifies the end of input.
MACHTYPE	A string describing the current system Bash is running on.
MAILCHECK	How often, in seconds, Bash checks for new mail.
MAILPATH	A colon-separated list of filenames which Bash checks
		for new mail.
OSTYPE		The version of Unix this version of Bash is running on.
PATH            A colon-separated list of directories to search when
		looking for commands.
PROMPT_COMMAND  A command to be executed before the printing of each
		primary prompt.
PS1             The primary prompt string.
PS2             The secondary prompt string.
PWD		The full pathname of the current directory.
SHELLOPTS	A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.
TERM            The name of the current terminal type.
TIMEFORMAT	The output format for timing statistics displayed by the
		`time' reserved word.
auto_resume     Non-null means a command word appearing on a line by
		itself is first looked for in the list of currently
		stopped jobs.  If found there, that job is foregrounded.
		A value of `exact' means that the command word must
		exactly match a command in the list of stopped jobs.  A
		value of `substring' means that the command word must
		match a substring of the job.  Any other value means that
		the command must be a prefix of a stopped job.
#if defined (HISTORY)
#  if defined (BANG_HISTORY)
histchars       Characters controlling history expansion and quick
		substitution.  The first character is the history
		substitution character, usually `!'.  The second is
		the `quick substitution' character, usually `^'.  The
		third is the `history comment' character, usually `#'.
#  endif /* BANG_HISTORY */
HISTIGNORE	A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which
		commands should be saved on the history list.
#endif /* HISTORY */
$END
