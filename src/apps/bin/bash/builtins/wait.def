$BUILTIN wait
$FUNCTION wait_builtin

$SHORT_DOC wait [n]
Wait for the specified process and report its termination status.  If
N is not given, all currently active child processes are waited for,
and the return code is zero.  N may be a process ID or a job
specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in the job's
pipeline are waited for.
