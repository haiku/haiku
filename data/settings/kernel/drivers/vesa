# For example, uncomment the line below to use 1280x1024 with 32bit colors (if available):
#mode 1280 1024 32

# Set NVIDIA scaling mode.

# Enable bios patching.
# On some video cards, the VESA driver is able to inject custom video resolutions in the BIOS.
# This does not modify the BIOS in the hardware, the changes are erased on reboot. However,
# this is outside of VESA specifications and sometimes results in a black screen. As a result,
# this feature is disabled by default for most cards.
